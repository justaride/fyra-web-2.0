# **Hotel Sustainability Certifications in Sweden and the Nordics**

## **Landscape of Hotel Sustainability Certifications in the Nordics**

The Nordic hotel industry engages with a mix of international certification systems, regional ecolabels, and chain-specific sustainability programs to demonstrate environmental performance. Below is a mapping of the most relevant schemes:

* Internationally Used Certifications in Sweden/Nordics:  
  * *LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design):* A global green building rating system focusing on sustainable design and construction. Hotels in Sweden have pursued LEED for new builds or major renovations  
  * [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=Fastigheten%20Skansen%2018%20har%20certifierats,g%C3%A4rna%20mer%20hos%20Stena%20Fastigheter)  
  * .  
  * *BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method):* A UK-based green building certification, including a BREEAM-SE version for Sweden. Used for high-profile hotel projects like the *House of Choice* (Nordic Choice Hotels HQ/hotel in Solna) which achieved BREEAM-SE Excellent  
  * [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=N%C3%A4r%20Fabeges%20projekt%20tog%20hem,%E2%80%9D)  
  * [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=Entrepren%C3%B6r%3A%20Skanska)  
  * .  
  * *Green Key:* An international eco-certification for hospitality operations, popular in 90+ countries (8,000+ establishments)  
  * [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/#:~:text=Green%20Key%20More%20than%208%2C000,leading%20standard%20for%20excellence)  
  * . Widely adopted in Scandinavia by hotels, conference centers, etc., focusing on operational sustainability and staff/guest engagement  
  * [fcmtravel.com](https://www.fcmtravel.com/se-se/resurser/resehubben/10-hallbarhetscertifieringar-inom-resor-du-bor-ha-koll-pa#:~:text=)  
  * .  
  * *Green Globe:* A global tourism sustainability certification (aligned with GSTC criteria) covering environmental, social, and cultural management. It provides a broad checklist for hotels (energy, water, waste, community) and requires annual improvement.  
  * *EarthCheck:* A science-based benchmarking and certification program, often used by resorts and event venues  
  * [fcmtravel.com](https://www.fcmtravel.com/se-se/resurser/resehubben/10-hallbarhetscertifieringar-inom-resor-du-bor-ha-koll-pa#:~:text=)  
  * . It involves annual audits of metrics like energy use, GHG emissions, water, waste, and social impact. Focuses on continuous performance improvement rather than prescriptive design criteria.  
  * *ISO 14001:* An international standard for Environmental Management Systems. Many Nordic hotel chains (e.g. Strawberry/Nordic Choice) certify their entire operations to ISO 14001  
  * [strawberry.no](https://www.strawberry.no/globalassets/global/csr/annual-report-pdf/annual-report-wecare-2019.pdf#:~:text=general,How%20we%20ensure%20compliance)  
  * . This ensures a systematic approach to managing environmental impact but does not impose specific performance thresholds.  
  * *EU Ecolabel for Tourist Accommodations:* The EU’s official ecolabel has a category for tourist lodging. Certification requires meeting 22 mandatory criteria plus a point score on optional criteria  
  * [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=allow%20proper%20guest%20satisfaction,the%20use%20of%20toxic%20substances)  
  * . It emphasizes reduced energy/water consumption, proper waste management, and limiting toxic substances  
  * [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=mandatory%20criteria%2C%20and%20receive%20at,synergies%20between%20various%20EU%20Ecolabel)  
  * . Synergies are encouraged with EU Ecolabel products (furniture, detergents, textiles, etc.) by rewarding their use  
  * [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=http%3A%2F%2Fec,within%20the%20tourist%20accommodations%20criteria)  
  * .  
  * *Travelife for Hotels & Accommodations:* A certification program recognized by tour operators (e.g. TUI) focusing on sustainable management and corporate social responsibility. Hotels must meet criteria in environmental impact (energy, water, waste), fair labor, and community support to achieve Travelife Gold. (Travelife is widely used in Europe’s travel industry, though not explicitly highlighted in Nordic markets’ public discourse as much as Green Key or Swan.)  
* Nordic/Swedish Certification Schemes:  
  * *Nordic Swan Ecolabel (Svanen) – Hotels:* The official Nordic ecolabel, known for strict environmental criteria. Many Swedish hotels (especially chains like Scandic) are Swan certified  
  * [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Scandic%20reached%20a%20sustainability,by%20the%20Nordic%20Swan%20Ecolabel)  
  * . Criteria span operational limits on energy, water, waste, use of eco-friendly chemicals, a percentage of organic food, and requirements for eco-labeled furnishings and textiles  
  * [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=To%20be%20certified%20by%20the,these%20hotels%20can%20start%20their)  
  * . The Swan is a Type I ecolabel covering the full lifecycle impact of the hotel’s services.  
  * *Miljöbyggnad:* A Swedish green building certification (by SGBC) for new or existing buildings. It rates buildings Bronze/Silver/Gold based on energy use, indoor environment (air quality, daylight, acoustics), and chemical building materials. Some newer hotels in Sweden have Miljöbyggnad ratings (e.g. Grow Hotel Solna achieved preliminary Miljöbyggnad Guld  
  * [humlegarden.se](https://www.humlegarden.se/vara-fastigheter-och-omraden/vara-fastigheter/grow-hotel/#:~:text=Fastighet%20Stenh%C3%B6ga%202%2C%20Grow%20Hotel,den%20danska%20arkitektfirman%203XN)  
  * ). However, Miljöbyggnad primarily addresses the building’s performance and material health (requiring documentation of building products to avoid hazardous substances), rather than hotel-specific operations.  
  * *Miljöbyggnad iDrift:* A newer Swedish certification for existing building operations (including hotels), focusing on operational sustainability and maintenance. This is analogous to BREEAM In-Use or LEED O+M, but it’s still gaining traction in the market.  
  * *Nordic Swan vs. EU Ecolabel:* Notably, the Nordic Swan and EU Ecolabel criteria for hotels are similar in scope (energy, water, waste, chemicals). Some hotels choose one or the other. The Nordic Swan has strong regional recognition (and is viewed as one of the world’s strictest ecolabels)  
  * [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=The%20Nordic%20Swan%20Ecolabel%20is,ups%20and%20team%20member%20training)  
  * , whereas EU Ecolabel is recognized EU-wide  
  * [fcmtravel.com](https://www.fcmtravel.com/se-se/resurser/resehubben/10-hallbarhetscertifieringar-inom-resor-du-bor-ha-koll-pa#:~:text=milj%C3%B6ansvar%2C%20genom%20att%20anv%C3%A4nda%20milj%C3%B6v%C3%A4nligare,informera%20g%C3%A4sterna%20om%20h%C3%A5llbar%20turism)  
  * . Both are Type I third-party certifications with regular audits.  
  * *Visita’s Initiatives:* Visita (the Swedish Hospitality industry association) does not run a dedicated hotel sustainability certificate for properties, but it actively promotes sustainability via its Sustainability Programme and training (aligned to UN Agenda 2030\)  
  * [visita.se](https://visita.se/app/uploads/2023/10/Visita-Sustainability-programme.pdf#:~:text=Today%2C%20Sweden%20has%20perhaps%20the,The%20hospitality%20industry%20must)  
  * [visita.se](https://visita.se/app/uploads/2023/10/Visita-Sustainability-programme.pdf#:~:text=Consuming%20the%20experiences%20and%20services,the%20solution%20for%20sustainable%20development)  
  * . Visita encourages members to adopt certifications (Visita partnered with Booking.com and GSTC to raise certified room share to 60% by 2025  
  * [gstc.org](https://www.gstc.org/certification/become-certified-hotel/#:~:text=Become%20a%20Certified%20Hotel%2FAccommodation%20By,accredited%20Certification%20Body)  
  * ). Essentially, Visita supports schemes like Green Key, Swan, etc., rather than issuing its own eco-label for hotels.  
  * *Other Regional Labels:* In Norway, Miljøfyrtårn (Eco-Lighthouse) is common, but in Sweden the closest equivalent is Svensk Miljöbas or municipal “miljödiplomering” – though these are more general environmental diplomas often superseded by the stricter international certifications for larger hotels. Another emerging program is EcoStars (a hotel sustainability rating awarding 1–5 “eco-stars” based on per-guest-night footprint), which is gaining recognition via travel agencies  
  * [sunweb.se](https://www.sunweb.se/hallbarhetscertifierat#:~:text=EcoStars)  
  * .  
* Hotel Chain Programs and Standards:  
  * *Scandic Hotels:* A sustainability pioneer in Scandinavia. Scandic adopted ISO 14001 two decades ago and in the 1990s partnered with the Swan label  
  * [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=environmental%20labeling%2C%20says%20Jens%20Mathiesen%2C,CEO%20of%20Scandic%20Hotels%20Group)  
  * . As of 2023, \~88% of Scandic’s hotels are Nordic Swan Ecolabeled and the chain is recertifying all hotels under the Swan’s latest criteria  
  * [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Scandic%20reached%20a%20sustainability,by%20the%20Nordic%20Swan%20Ecolabel)  
  * . Scandic’s efforts have yielded major reductions in resource use (1996–2022: –32% water per guest night, –31% energy, –65% CO₂e emissions)  
  * [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=Scandic%20initiated%20a%20long,for%20energy%20and%20heat%20optimization)  
  * . Scandic also imposes sustainability criteria on suppliers (e.g. only purchasing TVs, beds, cleaning chemicals that are eco-certified)  
  * [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=Several%20initiatives%20to%20create%20behavioral,laundry%20products%20are%20environmentally%20certified)  
  * . Their in-house *Sustainability Scorecard* includes energy per guest-night, food waste reduction, etc., aligning with certification metrics.  
  * *Strawberry (Nordic Choice Hotels):* This hotel group (formerly Nordic Choice) runs a program called WeCare. All hotels are ISO 14001 certified  
  * [strawberryhotels.com](https://www.strawberryhotels.com/sustainability/sustainable-operations/#:~:text=goals%2C%20and%20investing%20in%20new,technology%20to%20reduce%20energy%20consumption)  
  *  and the company has bold targets like climate-neutral operations by 2030  
  * [strawberryhotels.com](https://www.strawberryhotels.com/sustainability/sustainable-operations/#:~:text=We%20have%20the%20most%20ambitious,technology%20to%20reduce%20energy%20consumption)  
  * [strawberryhotels.com](https://www.strawberryhotels.com/sustainability/sustainable-operations/#:~:text=What%20we%20mean%20by%20climate,neutrality)  
  * . They emphasize ethical sourcing (e.g. 100% sustainable palm oil since 2015\)  
  * [s201.q4cdn.com](https://s201.q4cdn.com/538915302/files/doc_downloads/2024/Choice-Hotels-2024-Sustainability-Report.pdf#:~:text=,used%20sustainably%20produced%20palm)  
  *  and use organic food labels (KRAV/Debio) and sustainable seafood (MSC/ASC) across their restaurants  
  * [strawberry.no](https://www.strawberry.no/globalassets/global/csr/annual-report-pdf/annual-report-wecare-2019.pdf#:~:text=general,How%20we%20ensure%20compliance)  
  * . While Strawberry doesn’t use one single hotel ecolabel chain-wide, many of its hotels in Sweden and Norway carry additional labels (some were Swan ecolabeled or Green Key certified historically). The chain opened one of the Nordic region’s first zero-energy/“climate neutral” hotels (the Clarion Hotel® Air in Stavanger, with geothermal energy) as a flagship project  
  * [strawberryhotels.com](https://www.strawberryhotels.com/sustainability/sustainable-operations/#:~:text=First%20climate)  
  * .  
  * *Other International Chains:* Major global brands have internal sustainability standards often aligned with certifications:  
    * *Marriott:* via its *Serve 360* goals, encourages new builds to pursue LEED or similar, and measures hotels with an internal sustainability tracking system.  
    * *Hilton:* uses an internal ISO 14001-based system called *LightStay* for all properties, tracking 200+ metrics. Hilton’s system is essentially a chain-wide certification-equivalent, and some Hilton hotels also hold third-party labels (e.g. many Hilton in Europe have Green Key).  
    * *Radisson Hotel Group:* committed to all hotels being certified by a third party. Radisson properties in Sweden commonly hold Green Key as their chosen certification (Green Key has a partnership with Choice Hotels Int’l as well  
    * [media.choicehotels.com](https://media.choicehotels.com/2024-06-25-Green-Key-Global-Signs-Agreement-with-Choice-Hotels-International-to-Help-Franchisees-Improve-Sustainability-Practices-to-Obtain-its-Sought-After-Certification#:~:text=Press%20Releases%20,after%20certification)  
    * ).  
    * *Elite Hotels (Sweden):* This domestic upscale chain has adopted Green Key in several properties. For example, Elite Hotel Ideon Lund is Green Key certified and showcases “modern sustainability standards” and a strong commitment to environmental and social responsibility  
    * [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/toolbox-guest-info-bp#:~:text=responsibility)  
    * .  
    * *Smaller/Boutique Hotels:* Many independent hotels opt for Green Key or Swan to signal credibility to guests. E.g., Yasuragi Spa Hotel near Stockholm carries the Nordic Swan; Freys Hotel in Stockholm is Green Key certified (staff training in environmental work, microfibre cleaning, etc.  
    * [travelmyth.co.uk](https://www.travelmyth.co.uk/Sweden/Hotels/eco_friendly#:~:text=Travelmyth%20www,)  
    * ). These certifications serve as marketing tools to eco-conscious travelers and as frameworks for continuous improvement.

In summary, operational sustainability certifications (Green Key, Swan, etc.) are very popular in the Nordic hotel sector, while building-focused certifications (LEED, BREEAM, Miljöbyggnad) are pursued for major new developments or renovations. Many hotels stack both types – for instance, a new hotel might be built to BREEAM Excellent and then also obtain the Swan or Green Key for its ongoing operations.

## **Certification Profiles: Scope and Criteria Highlights**

Each certification/rating system has a different scope and depth. Below, we profile key certifications with emphasis on (1) Scope & coverage, (2) Materials and interior-related criteria, (3) Circular economy elements, (4) Certification process, (5) Adoption in Sweden, and (6) Credibility.

### **LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design)**

Scope & Coverage: LEED is a broad green building rating system (developed by USGBC) covering design and construction of buildings (LEED BD+C) and also operations (LEED O+M for existing buildings). It addresses site selection, water and energy efficiency, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation. LEED is voluntary and uses a credit-based scorecard (points are optional, accumulated toward certified/Silver/Gold/Platinum levels).

* Design/Construction vs. Operations: Primarily focuses on building design and construction (for new or renovated hotels). There are separate LEED programs for operations, but in Sweden most hotel usage is for construction projects (e.g. Downtown Camper by Scandic was LEED Gold for its major renovation  
* [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=Fastigheten%20Skansen%2018%20har%20certifierats,L%C3%A4s%20g%C3%A4rna%20mer)  
* ).

Materials & Interiors Criteria: LEED has robust criteria for building materials and interiors in its Materials & Resources (MR) and Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) categories:

* Use of recycled content materials and reused components is encouraged. LEED v4 awards points for reusing building structure or interior elements and for using products with Environmental Product Declarations or recycled content. *Example:* Downtown Camper’s LEED Gold retrofit reused the existing façade, floor slabs and walls, significantly conserving materials  
* [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=omfattande%20d%C3%A4r%20%C3%A5tg%C3%A4rder%20har%20genomf%C3%B6rts,g%C3%A4rna%20mer%20hos%20Stena%20Fastigheter)  
* . This reuse contributed to LEED credits for Building Life-Cycle Impact Reduction.  
* Certified wood: LEED gives credit if a high percentage of wood is FSC-certified (sustainably harvested).  
* Low-emitting materials: Stringent VOC emission limits for interior paints, coatings, adhesives, flooring, furniture, and furnishings to ensure healthy indoor air. Hotels pursuing LEED must choose low-VOC finishes and materials.  
* Furniture selection: In LEED for Interior Design & Construction (ID+C), there are credits for using furnishings that are low-emitting and sustainably sourced. While LEED doesn’t prescribe specific furniture brands, it incentivizes furniture with sustainability certifications or reuse.  
* Lighting and appliances: Energy-efficient lighting (LED, smart controls) is covered under Energy credits; interior lighting quality (for occupant comfort) is also considered (e.g. controls for guestroom lighting, daylighting credits).  
* Hazardous substances: LEED’s material credits indirectly address this by rewarding projects that avoid materials with certain chemical toxins (via material ingredient reporting and opting for products meeting green chemistry standards).

Circular Economy Elements: LEED v4 introduced a greater focus on lifecycle and circular principles:

* Building reuse & adaptive reuse (as noted above) directly rewards circular use of existing structures.  
* Construction waste management: credits for recycling or salvaging a high percentage of construction waste, reducing landfill.  
* Design for flexibility: not an explicit credit, but LEED encourages durability and adaptable design through its focus on long-term performance.  
* There are pilot credits in LEED for Design for Deconstruction and circularity concepts, but these are not core requirements. Nonetheless, LEED projects often inherently adopt circular practices (reuse, recycling) to earn points.

Certification Process: LEED requires registration of the project, documentation of all credits, and third-party review by GBCI. It’s typically pursued by larger new-build projects due to cost and complexity. Certification is one-time (for the project), with optional ongoing certification (LEED O+M) for operations later. Costs include registration and review fees plus substantial consulting effort. In Sweden, LEED consultants or SGBC can assist; the process can take months to a year. Adoption in Sweden: A handful of hotel buildings have LEED certification (approx. \~5 hotel buildings as of \~2020

[stenafastigheter.se](https://www.stenafastigheter.se/stena-fastigheter/nyheter-och-press/leed-guld-pa-skansen-18/#:~:text=LEED%20guld%20p%C3%A5%20Skansen%2018,09)

). Notable examples: *Courtyard by Marriott Stockholm (LEED Gold, 2010\)*, *Scandic Downtown Camper Stockholm (LEED Gold, 2017 retrofit)*

[arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=,%E2%80%93%20l%C3%A4s%20mer%20l%C3%A4ngre%20ned)

[arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=Fastigheten%20Skansen%2018%20har%20certifierats,L%C3%A4s%20g%C3%A4rna%20mer)

, and *Hotel Draken Gothenburg (LEED BD+C v4 Gold, certified 2024\)*

[usgbc.org](https://www.usgbc.org/projects/hotell-draken#:~:text=Hotell%20Draken,certified%20on%3A%20March%2006%2C%202024)

. LEED in Sweden is usually seen in internationally branded or flagship properties in urban areas. The trend is slowly growing as investors demand high sustainability ratings. Credibility & Recognition: LEED is globally recognized and is a strong marketing asset (“LEED Gold” is seen as a mark of a green building). It has rigorous third-party verification. For investors and corporate clients, a LEED-certified hotel signals ESG leadership

[fcmtravel.com](https://www.fcmtravel.com/se-se/resurser/resehubben/10-hallbarhetscertifieringar-inom-resor-du-bor-ha-koll-pa#:~:text=LEED%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20av%20de,minska%20exponeringen%20f%C3%B6r%20skadliga%20%C3%A4mnen)

. However, LEED is focused on design efficiency; it may be less visible to leisure guests (who are more familiar with operational ecolabels like Green Key/Swan). There’s little risk of greenwashing due to LEED’s strict documentation, but achieving it is a higher bar than many operational certifications.

### **BREEAM and BREEAM-SE**

Scope & Coverage: BREEAM is a UK-origin green building rating system, similar to LEED but with customizable local versions. BREEAM-SE is the Swedish adaptation run by SGBC

[sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=,21)

. It covers a broad range: Management, Energy, Transport, Water, Materials, Waste, Pollution, Land Use, Health & Wellbeing, etc. BREEAM credits are either mandatory or flexible (point-based), with ratings from Pass to Outstanding.

* Focus is on Building Design and Construction, or BREEAM In-Use for operations. In hotel projects, BREEAM often guides the construction phase, influencing architecture, engineering, and material selection.

Materials & Interiors Criteria: BREEAM has a dedicated Materials section and also addresses interiors in Health & Wellbeing:

* Life-cycle impacts: credits for conducting Life Cycle Assessment to reduce a building’s embodied impacts.  
* Responsible sourcing: A significant portion of construction materials (including interior fit-out materials like flooring, walls) should be sourced from suppliers with certified environmental management (e.g. ISO 14001 or FSC for wood).  
* Reuse of materials: BREEAM rewards use of reclaimed or recycled materials. It also has a Waste category that encourages use of recycled aggregates and high recycling rates for construction waste.  
* Indoor VOC: Under Health, BREEAM requires that paints, adhesives, floor coverings, etc., meet EU VOC standards or equivalent – protecting indoor air quality for occupants. Low-emission furniture and fit-out materials are also encouraged.  
* Lighting and Comfort: BREEAM’s Energy and Health sections ensure efficient lighting and good indoor environmental quality (lighting levels, thermal comfort, acoustics) – indirectly pushing selection of high-quality lighting systems and acoustic materials in interiors.

Circular Economy Elements: BREEAM tends to integrate some circular principles:

* Adaptation and resilience: credits for designing for disassembly or adaptability are not explicit in older BREEAM versions, but innovation credits can be used to reward circular design measures.  
* Material efficiency: Some BREEAM assessments include workshops on material efficiency to minimize resource use.  
* Plus-energy buildings: While not exactly circular, BREEAM credits favor buildings that greatly reduce or eliminate carbon emissions (e.g., through renewables). The *Nationalarenan 3 (House of Choice)* project in Solna achieved BREEAM-SE Excellent and also Sweden’s first Net Zero Energy/“Plus-house” hotel  
* [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=I%20samband%20med%20att%20nomineringsperioden,vad%20som%20f%C3%B6rbrukas%20i%20fastighetsenergi)  
* [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=)  
* . In that project, the team set goals to *“reduce material usage and use the right materials in the right place, such as recycled aluminum in the façade and wood in atriums”*  
* [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=F%C3%B6rutom%20de%20grundl%C3%A4ggande%20faktorerna%20som,i%20atrierna%20d%C3%A4r%20bes%C3%B6karna%20vistas)  
*  – demonstrating circular use of recycled materials within a BREEAM framework.

Certification Process: BREEAM certification in Sweden is done via licensed BREEAM Assessors and SGBC. It requires evidence for each credit and involves both design-stage and post-construction stage assessments. Like LEED, it’s typically pursued by larger projects; cost and effort are significant (though BREEAM-SE Excellent/Outstanding can add property value). Annual renewals are not required except in BREEAM In-Use (operations) which has its own process. Adoption in Sweden: Several new hotel buildings have pursued BREEAM. *Comfort Hotel Solna, Stockholm* (Nationalarenan 3\) is a showcase, being “Scandinavia’s first plus-energy hotel” and BREEAM Excellent

[sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=N%C3%A4r%20Fabeges%20projekt%20tog%20hem,%E2%80%9D)

[sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=Entrepren%C3%B6r%3A%20Skanska)

. Another example is *Swedish Expo 2020 Pavilion (now a hotel facility)* which targeted BREEAM Outstanding. BREEAM is well-known among Swedish developers; however, hotel owners sometimes prefer Nordic systems (Miljöbyggnad or Swan) unless aiming for international recognition. Credibility & Recognition: In Europe, BREEAM is highly respected and recognized by investors. A BREEAM-certified hotel (especially Excellent/Outstanding) is seen as a top-tier sustainable building. Guest-facing marketing is less common (guests are rarely aware of “BREEAM” since it’s technical), but corporate clients and government travel organizers may value it. Like LEED, BREEAM has rigorous third-party checks, so greenwashing risk is low. It’s considered a robust demonstration of environmental performance of the building.

### **Nordic Swan Ecolabel (Hotels and Restaurants)**

Scope & Coverage: The Nordic Swan Ecolabel is a comprehensive Type I ecolabel for hotel and other accommodation services. It addresses operational sustainability holistically: purchasing, waste, energy, water, cleaning, and more. The Swan criteria apply to the whole hotel’s operations and supply chain (not the construction process, except indirectly via what the hotel buys for renovations or interiors). All criteria are mandatory limits or practices (it’s not point-based; all must be met to be certified). The label is voluntary but widely adopted in the Nordics, often as a mark of going beyond legal requirements. Materials & Interiors Criteria: Importantly, the Swan has specific requirements related to interiors and materials, which is somewhat unique among hotel eco-certifications:

* A certified hotel *“must purchase ecolabeled furniture and textiles”* for new acquisitions  
* [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=To%20be%20certified%20by%20the,these%20hotels%20can%20start%20their)  
* . This means when furniture (beds, sofas, chairs) or textiles (bed linens, towels, curtains) are procured, they should carry an ecolabel such as the Swan itself, EU Ecolabel, or OEKO-Tex for textiles, etc. This drives hotels to choose products with certified low toxicity, durability, and eco-friendly production.  
* There are strict chemical requirements: only environmentally friendly cleaning products, detergents, and soaps (typically those with Nordic Swan or EU Ecolabel) can be used  
* [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=To%20be%20certified%20by%20the,and%20waste%2C%20and%20have%20clear)  
* . This reduces guest and staff exposure to harmful VOCs and aquatic toxins.  
* No hazardous substances in interiors: The Swan criteria include bans on PVC in flooring or wall coverings (unless necessary), no fluorinated chemicals in textiles/furniture, and no flame retardants or other hazardous additives unless absolutely required (with safer alternatives encouraged).  
* Lighting and equipment: Hotels must phase out incandescent lighting in favor of energy-efficient lighting (LED) and have policies for turning off lights and equipment. While this is energy-focused, it affects the selection of interior lighting fixtures.  
* Recycled and recyclable materials: The Swan rewards or expects use of recycled content in consumables (e.g. paper products must be recycled or ecolabeled). For durable goods like furniture, using products with recycled materials would likely be covered if those products are ecolabeled (since ecolabel criteria for furniture include recycled content and sustainable wood  
* [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/technical_report_furniture.pdf#:~:text=,foams%2C%20latex%20foams%20and%20glass)  
* ).  
* Indoor environment: Though Swan focuses on environmental impact, it indirectly covers interiors through requiring a smoke-free environment, good ventilation, and using products (paints, varnishes, etc.) that are low-emission (e.g. EU Ecolabel paints).

Circular Economy Relevance: The Swan’s orientation is largely on reducing daily environmental footprint, but it does touch on circularity:

* By requiring products that are durable and ecolabeled, it ensures furnishings have longer life and can be recycled (ecolabel criteria for furniture and textiles include quality and recyclability factors).  
* Some newer Swan criteria give points or requirements for waste reduction measures like offering guests reusable options (no single-use toiletries, etc.) and for separating and recycling waste at high rates. Swan-certified hotels eliminate single-use plastics wherever possible and implement textile re-use programs (e.g. towel and linen reuse is mandatory).  
* However, explicit credits for *reuse of furniture* or *design for disassembly* are not a focus – the Swan leans more on procurement of environmentally sound new items rather than encouraging reuse of old furniture. (This is a noted gap: circular design is not heavily incentivized aside from the general waste reduction ethos.)

Operational vs. Design Criteria: The Swan is heavily operations-focused. It addresses the running of the hotel (energy monitoring, % renewable energy, water per guest-night limits, waste sorting and reduction, staff training, guest communication, food sourcing etc.)

. There are relatively few criteria about the building’s design itself – it assumes the building exists and focuses on its performance. For example, there is no explicit requirement for building insulation levels (that’s covered by building codes and possibly other certifications), but there is a requirement that no oil or coal heating is used and that energy consumption per occupied room is below set thresholds. In practice many Swan hotels also implement design improvements to meet energy limits (e.g. upgrading HVAC or insulation to reduce energy use). Certification Process: To get the Swan, a hotel goes through an application with the Nordic Ecolabelling organization. They must document compliance with all criteria (which number in the dozens, covering everything from housekeeping routines to technical installations). Key performance metrics (energy kWh/m², water liters/guest-night, waste kg, organic food %) must be measured and meet strict baseline values

[scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=Nordic%20countries,ups%20and%20team%20member%20training)

. An independent auditor verifies compliance on-site. Certification is granted for a period (typically 3 years) with annual follow-up checks

[scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=continue%20to%20be%20certified%2C%20Scandic%E2%80%99s,ups%20and%20team%20member%20training)

. Fees include an application fee and annual license fee, scaled to the business size

. The process is rigorous; the Swan updates criteria every \~4 years, and hotels must recertify under new criteria (e.g. Scandic had to recertify all hotels to the 2023 upgraded standards)

[scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=The%20Nordic%20Swan%20Ecolabel%20is,ups%20and%20team%20member%20training)

. Market Adoption: The Nordic Swan is highly respected in Sweden and across the Nordic countries. As of 2023, 87 Scandic hotels in Sweden (and dozens more in Norway, Finland, Denmark) are Swan-certified

[scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=To%20be%20certified%20by%20the,these%20hotels%20can%20start%20their)

. Many other chains and independent hotels have also adopted it; it’s often a corporate decision (e.g. Scandic, Nordic Choice earlier, and smaller chains like Nordic Light/At Six have it). The trend is growing as the Swan label is seen as a mark of true environmental excellence – for instance, Scandic re-committed to certify *all* its Nordic hotels with the Swan

[scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Scandic%20reached%20a%20sustainability,by%20the%20Nordic%20Swan%20Ecolabel)

. The Swan is used across all segments from luxury to budget in Nordics. Even conference venues and hotels in rural areas pursue it to meet government or corporate client preferences. The Swedish government and many companies favor Swan or equivalent certification when booking hotels, driving adoption. Credibility & Recognition: The Nordic Swan is extremely well-recognized by Nordic consumers. Guests actively look for the Swan logo as an assurance that the hotel is operated to high environmental standards. It’s considered robust (no greenwashing), since criteria are strict and verified. In fact, Swan-certified hotels often achieve substantial impacts: Scandic credits the Swan process for helping eliminate harmful chemicals, cut water and energy use, and even influencing suppliers to provide greener products (“creating a ‘Swan effect’ in other industries” by demanding ecolabeled goods)

[scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=,CEO%20of%20Scandic%20Hotels%20Group)

. The Swan’s strictness is highlighted by external recognition (even the US EPA has praised the Swan’s rigor

[norden.org](https://www.norden.org/en/news/us-environmental-protection-agency-approves-nordic-swan-ecolabel#:~:text=US%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency%20approves,Using%20officially%20approved)

). Overall, credibility is very high, and having the Swan is a competitive advantage in the Nordic market.

### **Green Key**

Scope & Coverage: Green Key is an international eco-certification for hospitality businesses (hotels, hostels, campsites, attractions, etc.). Its scope covers the operation of the hotel – focusing on environmental management, staff involvement, guest awareness, and reducing resource use in energy, water, waste. Green Key criteria are a mix of mandatory and optional (guideline) criteria; all mandatory criteria must be met, and a certain number of optional ones must be fulfilled, with requirements increasing the longer a hotel is in the program

[greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=CRITERIA%20AND%20EXPLANATORY%20NOTES%20Criteria,comply%20with%20all%20imperative%20criteria)

[greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=and%20an%20increasing%20number%20of,9%2020%25%2010%2B%2050)

.

* It heavily emphasizes day-to-day operations and policies: having an environmental management plan, regular monitoring of consumption, staff training, and guest communication (information for guests on how to be sustainable during their stay).

Materials & Interiors Criteria: Green Key does include some criteria related to materials and interiors, largely as optional “guideline” criteria aimed at promoting sustainable procurement and reuse:

* Sustainable purchasing of durables: One guideline criterion requires *“at least 75% of newly purchased durables have an eco-label or come from a company with an environmental management system”*  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=13.8%20At%20least%2075,and%20longer%20lasting%20use%2C%20and)  
* . “Durables” here include furniture, carpets, and other long-life items  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=Durables%20are%20products%20made%20to,a%20company%20with%20an%20environmental)  
* . This means a hotel can earn points by buying, for example, furniture certified with an ecolabel (EU Ecolabel, Nordic Swan furniture criteria, etc.) or from manufacturers with ISO 14001, thereby encouraging greener furniture and interior decor choices.  
* Refurbished or second-hand furniture: Another Green Key guideline encourages that the hotel *“refurbishes or upcycles its own durables or purchases second-hand durables”*  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=13,within%20the%20past%2012%20months)  
*  within the past year. This explicitly promotes giving furniture, carpets, etc., a second life to reduce the footprint of new production  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=For%20the%20establishment%20to%20reduce,efficiency%20of%20these%20products%20must)  
* . Compliance is shown by documentation of such purchases or refurbishments  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=include%20furniture%2C%20carpets%2C%20tableware%2C%20etc,within%20the%20last%2012%20months)  
* . This is a clear nod to circular economy principles (reduce and reuse).  
* Eco-friendly cleaning and maintenance: Imperative criteria require that *at least 75% of cleaning chemicals used daily have a nationally or internationally recognized eco-label* (for instance, Green Seal, EU Ecolabel)  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=hazardous%20chemicals%20is%20minimised,an%20internationally%20or%20nationally%20recognised)  
* . Similarly, 75% of guest toiletries (soap, shampoo) must be eco-labeled  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L1980%20To%20reduce,label%2C%20it%20is)  
* . This controls hazardous substances and indoor air quality (since many eco-labeled products also have low VOC and fewer toxic ingredients). It also indirectly affects materials longevity (gentler chemicals mean longer life for textiles and surfaces).  
* Textiles: While Green Key doesn’t specifically require organic or eco-labeled textiles, it encourages reduction of laundry (towel/linen reuse programs are mandatory) and efficient laundry processes. Some national operators may add criteria for sustainable textiles. (The Green Key Toolbox highlights best practices like hotels using organic cotton linens, but it’s not a formal requirement globally.)  
* Lighting & equipment: Green Key mandatory criteria cover replacing all lighting with energy-efficient bulbs (LED or CFL) and using key-card master switches or sensors to avoid wastage. It also includes criteria for energy-efficient appliances and HVAC. So, interior lighting systems and appliances must be upgraded as part of certification.  
* Waste & recycling in renovations: If a Green Key hotel undergoes refurbishment, the program expects proper handling of resultant waste (though this may fall under general waste management criteria). There is also a guideline criterion on safe storage and handling of hazardous materials like paints, batteries, etc., to ensure responsible maintenance  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=chemicals%20are%20stored%20safely,and%20health%20hazards%20for%20the)  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=hazardous%20chemicals%20are%20located%20in,appliances%2C%20cleaning%20material%2C%20swimming%20pool)  
* .

Circular Economy Elements: Green Key’s philosophy aligns with “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle”. Several criteria embed circular practices:

* Reuse is encouraged via second-hand furniture use  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=13,within%20the%20past%2012%20months)  
*  and offering refillable dispensers (hotels must not use disposable toiletry bottles and instead use refillable ones or bulk dispensers).  
* Waste sorting (recycling bins for at least paper, plastic, glass, cardboard, hazardous waste etc.) is mandatory, and waste reduction measures (like no single-use cutlery/plates, no plastic straws, etc.) are part of the program.  
* Water refill stations to avoid plastic bottles and incentives for guests to save resources (some Green Key hotels give a voucher if you skip housekeeping – supporting resource saving).  
* While design for circularity is not explicitly covered (Green Key does not demand modular furniture or material passports), its procurement and reuse criteria move hotels toward circular economy by extending product lifespans and closing material loops where feasible.

Certification Process: Hotels apply through their national Green Key operator. The process involves an initial self-assessment against the criteria checklist

[greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/criteria#:~:text=Green%20Key%20certified%20establishments%20meet,the%20same%2013%20criteria%20areas)

[greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/criteria#:~:text=Most%20criteria%20are%20imperative%20and,in%20the%20Green%20Key%20programme)

, implementation of any needed improvements, and an on-site audit by Green Key representatives. The certificate is awarded for one year at a time; annual renewal is required, with submission of updated data and sometimes inspections. This annual cycle pushes continuous improvement. Costs are moderate (scaled by hotel size); Green Key is often seen as one of the more accessible certifications for hotels of all sizes because of its flexible guideline criteria system. Adoption in Sweden: Green Key is well-established in Sweden, operated by the organization “Green Key Sverige” (often in cooperation with Keep Sweden Tidy). There are numerous Swedish Green Key certified hotels – including many Radisson Blu and Park Inn hotels, Elite Hotels, some Scandic and Nordic Choice properties, and independent hotels. For example, Elite Marina Tower Stockholm and Elite Ideon Lund are Green Key certified, as is Clarion Hotel Stockholm (part of Strawberry) and many smaller venues. According to travel industry sources, Green Key is one of the top certifications to “have koll på” (be aware of) for hotels and conference venues in Sweden

[fcmtravel.com](https://www.fcmtravel.com/se-se/resurser/resehubben/10-hallbarhetscertifieringar-inom-resor-du-bor-ha-koll-pa#:~:text=10%20h%C3%A5llbarhetscertifieringar%20inom%20resor%20du,aktivt%20f%C3%B6r%20h%C3%A5llbarhet%20och)

[vastsverige.com](https://www.vastsverige.com/turistradet-vastsverige/Artiklar/information-om-hallbarhetscertifiering/#:~:text=Funderar%20du%20p%C3%A5%20vilka%20certifieringar,certifieringar%20och%20milj%C3%B6m%C3%A4rkningar%20med)

. The Green Key program is growing globally and in Sweden, with increasing recognition especially via online travel agents (Booking.com and others now flag Green Key hotels as sustainable options). Credibility & Recognition: Green Key is internationally recognized (endorsed by the UN World Tourism Organization and GSTC). In Sweden/Nordics, it is seen as slightly less stringent than the Nordic Swan, but still a solid certification proving a hotel’s active sustainability efforts

[fcmtravel.com](https://www.fcmtravel.com/se-se/resurser/resehubben/10-hallbarhetscertifieringar-inom-resor-du-bor-ha-koll-pa#:~:text=)

. It might carry a *bit* less guest-facing cachet than the Swan (since Swan is a government-backed label), but Green Key’s advantage is global reach – foreign guests recognize it too. The certification is externally verified, though some criteria are guideline-based which gives flexibility (critics might say this could allow a hotel to do minimum in some areas; however, the mandatory criteria ensure a baseline of performance). Overall, it’s considered a reputable mark. Green Key hotels often promote it on their websites and in lobbies, and it’s a deciding factor for many corporate travel managers choosing accommodations for employee travel. No major greenwashing concerns, as Green Key is GSTC-recognized and undergoes audits, but the level of performance can vary (one hotel might excel in energy saving, another might just meet minimums but both carry the label).

### **EU Ecolabel for Tourist Accommodations**

Scope & Coverage: The EU Ecolabel (the “EU Flower”) is an official EU-wide ecolabel that includes a standard for Tourist Accommodation Services. Its scope is broad and similar in spirit to the Nordic Swan: it covers the entire service operation of hotels, focusing on energy, water, waste, chemicals, and other key impacts

[ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=mandatory%20criteria%2C%20and%20receive%20at,other%20ISO%20type%20I%20label)

. To be certified, a hotel must meet 22 mandatory criteria (which set minimum environmental performance thresholds) and score at least 20 points from a list of optional criteria

[ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=allow%20proper%20guest%20satisfaction,the%20use%20of%20toxic%20substances)

. The optional criteria allow hotels to earn points in areas where they exceed the basics – many of these overlap with circular economy practices. Materials & Interiors Criteria: The EU Ecolabel criteria encourage sustainable materials use in several ways:

* Eco-labeled furnishings and fittings: Optional Criterion 52 *“Durable goods”* awards up to 4 points if the hotel’s furnishings and equipment are eco-certified. Specifically, if at least 40% of items in categories like *bed linen/towels*, *mattresses*, *furniture*, *floor coverings*, etc., have the EU Ecolabel or another Type I ecolabel, the hotel earns points  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=3.3.9.2%20Criterion%2052%20,linen%2C%20towels%20and%20table%20clothes)  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=At%20least%2040,bed%20mattresses)  
* . For example, using EU Ecolabel or Nordic Swan certified furniture (which meets strict environmental and health criteria) would fulfill one category  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=At%20least%2040,bed%20mattresses)  
* . This pushes hotels to choose environmentally vetted interior products (low emissions, sustainable materials).  
* Low-toxicity materials: It has mandatory criteria to eliminate or limit certain hazardous substances. For instance, no ozone-depleting substances in cooling/heating, low VOC paints/varnishes must be used in any renovations (these requirements align with EU chemical regulations and are likely covered in the “toxic substances” focus  
* [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=mandatory%20criteria%2C%20and%20receive%20at,other%20ISO%20type%20I%20label)  
* ).  
* Recycled content & recyclability: While not directly mandating recycled furniture, the EU Ecolabel gives preference to products that are designed for longevity and recyclability  
* [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=http%3A%2F%2Fec,within%20the%20tourist%20accommodations%20criteria)  
* . Also, optional points exist for using recycled paper products, etc., which extends to some interior items (e.g. furniture with recycled materials could be indirectly credited if it carries an ecolabel).  
* Textiles and amenities: Mandatory criteria include phasing out single-use toiletry bottles in favor of refillables, using detergents and cleaning products that are EU Ecolabel or equivalent (similar to Swan). Optional points for linen reuse program and use of organic or ecolabeled cotton for bed linens and towels are likely included (as hinted by synergies with EU Ecolabel textile products  
* [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=http%3A%2F%2Fec,within%20the%20tourist%20accommodations%20criteria)  
* ).  
* Lighting and HVAC: Mandatory energy criteria require efficient lighting and climate control. Optional points for 100% LED lighting and automatic off controls (presence sensors, keycards) are given. These influence interior design choices (e.g., installing motion sensors in corridors, choosing efficient mini-bar fridges for rooms, etc.).

Circular Economy Elements: The EU Ecolabel scheme explicitly integrates circular economy thinking in some optional criteria:

* Criterion 57 – “Used textiles and furniture” awards up to 2 points if the hotel has procedures for donating or reusing items and for buying second-hand  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=3.3.9.7%20Criterion%2057%20,products%20procurement%20activities%20for%20furniture)  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=The%20tourist%20accommodation%20shall%20have,associations%2Fcollectives%20which%20sell%20or%20redistribute)  
* . Specifically: (a) the hotel should donate used furniture and textiles that are no longer needed but still usable (to charities, employees, etc.)  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=The%20tourist%20accommodation%20shall%20have,associations%2Fcollectives%20which%20sell%20or%20redistribute)  
* , and (b) the hotel should procure some furniture second-hand or from reuse suppliers  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=their%20usable%20life%20within%20the,1)  
* . Each of those actions yields 1 point  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=3.3.9.7%20Criterion%2057%20,products%20procurement%20activities%20for%20furniture)  
* . This directly encourages circular practices of extending product life and using reclaimed goods.  
* Waste management & recycling: Mandatory criteria require at least separation of waste (paper, plastic, metal, glass, etc.) for recycling. Optional points for composting organic waste are offered  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=3.3.9.6%20Criterion%2056%20,a%20procedure%20in%20place%20covering)  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=3.3.9.7%20Criterion%2057%20,products%20procurement%20activities%20for%20furniture)  
* .  
* Durability and maintenance: By emphasizing durable goods and giving points for maintenance that extends life (e.g. proper care of textiles to extend usage), the label promotes resource efficiency (not using more materials than necessary).  
* Consumables reduction: The EU Ecolabel requires measures like not offering single-use cups or plates at breakfast, using bulk dispensers for soap/shampoo, and encouraging paperless processes – all of which reduce material consumption and waste.

Overall, the EU Ecolabel is aligned with circular economy principles by pushing reuse and ensuring products have lower lifecycle impact. It’s one of the few schemes that formalize donation and second-hand procurement as criteria

[susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=The%20tourist%20accommodation%20shall%20have,associations%2Fcollectives%20which%20sell%20or%20redistribute)

. Certification Process: The EU Ecolabel is administered by national competent bodies (in Sweden, it’s via Miljömärkning Sverige who also handle the Swan). The hotel must compile documentation for each criterion, including utility data, purchase records (to show eco-labeled product use), policies, etc. An on-site audit is conducted. The threshold of 20 optional points means hotels can play to their strengths (e.g. a hotel with a restaurant might get points for organic food, whereas a small B\&B might skip that but focus on solar water heating, etc.). Once certified, the label is valid for usually two years, after which re-evaluation is needed (or whenever criteria are updated). Fees are typically lower than Swan (EU Ecolabel has a cap on fees to encourage uptake). Adoption in Sweden: The EU Ecolabel for accommodations has had relatively low uptake in Sweden compared to the Nordic Swan. This is partly because Swedish/Nordic hotels gravitated to the homegrown Swan label (which covers similar ground). A few examples exist – for instance, *STF (Swedish Tourist Association) Vandrarhem* or nature lodges have considered it, and some camping sites have it. But the Nordic Swan’s dominance overshadows the EU Flower in the Nordics. In other European countries, the EU Ecolabel is more commonly seen on hotels (especially in Southern/Mediterranean Europe). Swedish hotels catering to EU-wide tour operators might consider it or Travelife. That said, given increasing EU focus on standardized labels, interest may grow. (As of 2025, no comprehensive list of Swedish EU Ecolabel hotels is readily published; they number only a handful if any, versus hundreds with Swan or Green Key.) Credibility & Recognition: The EU Ecolabel is a robust, government-backed certification with very stringent criteria

[nordic-swan-ecolabel.org](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/criteria/hotels-and-other-accommodation-055/#:~:text=,Development%20Goals)

greenthehotels.com

. It’s on par with the Nordic Swan in terms of environmental rigor (in fact, many criteria overlap or are mutually recognized). However, in the Swedish market, the “Flower” is less recognized by the public than the Swan. Internationally, an EU Ecolabel hotel might impress environmentally conscious EU travelers and is recognized in sustainability reports (e.g. it’s one of the labels Booking.com and others highlight). There’s no greenwash risk: it’s third-party audited and quite difficult to achieve. The only challenge is marketing – hotels often have to explain what the EU Flower means, whereas in Sweden the Swan speaks for itself.

### **ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System Standard)**

Scope & Coverage: ISO 14001 is not a hotel-specific label but a management system certification. It certifies that a hotel (or company) has an effective system to manage its environmental aspects and legal compliance, with continuous improvement. The scope covers all operations of the hotel, but does not set specific performance criteria (no numeric targets for energy, etc. – those are set by the company’s own objectives).

* It’s voluntary and process-oriented. A hotel chain can get a group certification (as Nordic Choice did for all hotels  
* [strawberry.no](https://www.strawberry.no/globalassets/global/csr/annual-report-pdf/annual-report-wecare-2019.pdf#:~:text=general,How%20we%20ensure%20compliance)  
* ), meaning each property follows the chain’s environmental management program.

Materials & Interiors Criteria: ISO 14001 by itself does not contain prescriptive criteria for materials or interiors. Instead, it requires the hotel to identify environmental impacts (which could include procurement of furniture, generation of waste, etc.) and have objectives and procedures to control those impacts. For example:

* A hotel might set an objective “Reduce waste to landfill by 50%, including donating old furniture rather than disposing.” ISO 14001 would then require procedures, training, and monitoring to achieve that.  
* If hazardous materials (paints, chemicals) are used, ISO 14001 ensures the hotel has proper handling and storage processes and works on phasing them out, but it doesn’t ban specific substances on its own – it defers to regulatory compliance and the hotel’s policy.  
* Many ISO 14001 certified hotels adopt internal policies to buy eco-labeled products or sustainable materials because they’ve identified it as a significant environmental aspect. But again, that’s internally driven rather than required by ISO 14001 itself.

Circular Economy Elements: Under ISO 14001, a hotel could incorporate circular economy goals (it has the flexibility to do so). For instance, a hotel might include in its environmental program a target to increase the proportion of refurbished furniture used in renovations or to implement a “furniture take-back program” with suppliers. ISO 14001 would then help formalize this (assign responsibility, track progress). The standard encourages reduction of resource use and waste as part of the planning process (via objectives and targets). However, any circular practices are only as strong as the organization’s commitment – ISO 14001 provides the framework and pressure for continuous improvement via annual audits. Many hotel chains with ISO 14001 (like Scandic, Strawberry) indeed set ambitious goals aligned with circular economy (e.g. eliminate single-use plastics, send zero waste to landfill, etc., in pursuit of their ISO-driven environmental objectives). Certification Process: The hotel (or chain) must develop an environmental management system (EMS) covering policy, impact analysis, legal compliance, training, documentation, and monitoring. An accredited certification body audits the system initially and then annually. Certification does not yield a consumer-facing logo like Swan/GreenKey, but hotels often mention “ISO 14001 certified” in corporate sustainability info. The process is substantial in effort but flexible to any size operation. ISO 14001 certification is typically renewed on a 3-year cycle (with surveillance audits in between). Adoption in Sweden: Many upscale or large hotels have ISO 14001\. Notably, Nordic Choice (Strawberry) had all its hotels ISO 14001 certified by 2010s

[strawberry.no](https://www.strawberry.no/globalassets/global/csr/annual-report-pdf/annual-report-wecare-2019.pdf#:~:text=general,How%20we%20ensure%20compliance)

, and Scandic hotels were early adopters of ISO 14001 in the 1990s. Also, chains like *Radisson* and *Hilton* globally often have ISO 14001 at least at corporate level or for individual hotels. In Sweden, even some independent hotels pursued ISO 14001 as an alternative to Swan (especially before 2010, when Swan criteria were perhaps fewer). Today, ISO 14001 is often used in conjunction with an eco-label: e.g., a hotel might be both ISO 14001 and Swan – ISO covers the management processes, Swan sets concrete performance benchmarks. Credibility & Recognition: ISO 14001 is highly credible in terms of internal rigor. It’s valued by investors and corporate clients as proof of systematic sustainability management

[fcmtravel.com](https://www.fcmtravel.com/se-se/resurser/resehubben/10-hallbarhetscertifieringar-inom-resor-du-bor-ha-koll-pa#:~:text=)

. However, it’s not very visible to consumers/guests – you won’t see an ISO 14001 logo on a booking site typically. Guests respond more to tangible labels (Swan, Green Key) that imply specific achievements. ISO 14001 could risk being an exercise in paperwork if not paired with strong company commitment; however, in practice Nordic hotel companies have leveraged ISO to drive real reductions (for example, Strawberry’s 35% emissions cut in 2 years was guided by their ISO-based monitoring and action plans

[strawberryhotels.com](https://www.strawberryhotels.com/sustainability/sustainable-operations/#:~:text=We%20have%20the%20most%20ambitious,technology%20to%20reduce%20energy%20consumption)

[strawberryhotels.com](https://www.strawberryhotels.com/sustainability/sustainable-operations/#:~:text=In%20just%20two%20years%2C%20from,from%20222%20to%20244%20hotels)

). There is minimal risk of greenwashing because third-party audits ensure the EMS is functioning, but ISO 14001 alone doesn’t guarantee a particular level of performance – just that the hotel knows and manages its impacts. Therefore, many hotels use ISO 14001 as a backbone and an eco-label to demonstrate outcomes.

### **Green Globe**

Scope & Coverage: Green Globe is a sustainability certification for tourism businesses that grew out of the UNWTO/WTTC initiative. It applies to hotels, resorts, and also attractions. Its scope is wide: sustainable management, social economics, cultural heritage, and environmental pillars, aligned with the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria (GSTC). Green Globe has around 40+ criteria plus detailed sub-criteria. These include everything from having a sustainability management plan, legal compliance, protecting cultural heritage, supporting local community, to typical environmental measures (energy, water, waste, emissions).

* It covers both operations and some aspects of design: e.g., it asks if the building and landscape are appropriate and don’t harm ecosystems, and if sustainability was considered in its design, but mostly it focuses on how the property is run.

Materials & Interiors Criteria: Green Globe’s criteria on materials are mostly about purchasing and waste:

* Hotels must have a sustainable purchasing policy that favors environmentally friendly products (e.g. recycled or eco-certified materials, locally made goods, etc.). This would include interior elements like choosing eco-friendly furniture, avoiding endangered wood species, and so on. It’s not extremely specific, but the intent is there: use “sustainable materials” where possible  
* [givingbag.com](https://www.givingbag.com/post/what-are-sustainable-hotel-certifications-and-why-they-matter#:~:text=Matter%3F%20www,sourcing%20sustainable%20materials%2C%20and)  
* .  
* Waste reduction and reuse: Green Globe certified hotels are required to have measures for reducing solid waste and safely handling hazardous materials. This implies practices like donating furniture, using refillable amenity dispensers, using durable rather than disposable goods, etc.  
* Indoor health: Criteria ensure that the hotel provides a safe, healthy environment (which would indirectly cover no smoking, good ventilation, maybe using non-toxic materials, though the standard doesn’t list VOC limits explicitly).  
* Community & Culture: Though not material-focused, Green Globe does require use of local art, cultural elements in decor in a respectful way (supporting local artisans can overlap with interior choices as well).

Green Globe is more of a management and performance checklist. For example, it might check that the hotel tracks how many tons of waste are recycled, whether it buys from local suppliers, etc. It doesn’t list, say, “furniture must be eco-labeled” – it’s more outcome-oriented: *“The organization contributes to resource conservation, including energy, water, and materials”* (paraphrasing likely criteria). Circular Economy Elements: Green Globe inherently encourages some circular economy aspects:

* The purchasing policy under Green Globe would encourage reduction of single-use goods and preference for reusable, repairable items.  
* Waste management includes recycling at minimum and likely composting. The criteria push to minimize waste generation (e.g. giving leftover materials to charity, implementing paperless check-in).  
* Some Green Globe hotels have innovative circular initiatives, but that’s driven by the hotel rather than the checklist. For instance, if a hotel implements a furniture take-back program with a supplier, that would satisfy multiple Green Globe criteria (sustainable procurement, waste reduction, community donation).  
* The standard aligns with GSTC which explicitly mentions that tourism businesses should reduce disposable goods and encourage reuse/recycling. So Green Globe-certified hotels are generally expected to be in the top tier for things like eliminating single-use plastics and engaging in recycling programs.

Certification Process: A hotel must first implement all required criteria, then an independent Green Globe accredited auditor conducts an on-site audit and document review. Certification is given for one year and requires annual surveillance audits (Green Globe emphasizes continuous improvement, so each year targets are revisited). The process is quite comprehensive, covering environmental metrics and also CSR aspects (staff training, community involvement). Green Globe provides an online system to track performance metrics annually, somewhat like EarthCheck. The cost is relatively high (often used by upscale resorts), and the hotel receives a score (must reach a certain score to pass). Adoption in Sweden: Green Globe is not common in Sweden. It has been more popular in certain regions (Caribbean, Asia, etc.) and among resort properties. Few Swedish hotels have pursued it; one example could be *Sigtuna Stadshotell* years ago, or a conference center that wanted an all-encompassing certificate. However, Swedish hoteliers generally opt for Swan, ISO, or Green Key. If an international chain property in Sweden is Green Globe certified, it’s the exception rather than the rule. (Green Globe’s presence in Europe tends to be more in leisure resorts or meeting venues wanting to market to international clients.) Credibility & Recognition: Green Globe is GSTC-Recognized/Accredited, meaning it meets global standards for robust certification. It’s fairly credible, though perhaps less known to the general public in Sweden. Internationally, a Green Globe certified resort can use the logo in marketing to signal comprehensive sustainability (covering social responsibility too). Because it covers so many dimensions, it is seen as a “holistic” label. For corporate/institutional recognition, it’s good, but for Nordic leisure travelers, the Swan or Green Key might resonate more. No significant greenwash risk – criteria are verified – but the breadth of Green Globe means some critics say it’s “a bit of everything” rather than excelling in one area. Still, any hotel that achieves Green Globe has clearly invested in sustainability improvements across the board.

### **Travelife for Hotels & Accommodations (*Bonus – widely used in travel industry*)**

*Note: The user’s query did not list Travelife, but it’s relevant as a Europe-focused hotel certification, so we include a brief profile.* Scope & Coverage: Travelife is a certification program designed for tour operators and hotels, focusing on sustainability in operations and management. It covers environmental impact (energy, water, waste), social issues (labor practices, community support), and guest communication. Travelife has around 163 criteria; hotels earn Travelife Gold if they meet the majority (including all core criteria). It’s a voluntary, point-based system with an emphasis on continuous improvement. Materials & Interiors Criteria: Travelife includes several criteria indirectly related to materials:

* Hotels must have an environmental purchasing policy – meaning they consider sustainability when buying products and services (e.g. favoring eco-friendly cleaning products, sustainable timber, local goods). This can extend to furniture and refurbishment materials.  
* They encourage use of low-impact materials in any renovation or new build, though it’s not extremely detailed. For instance, a Travelife hotel might get credit for using water-based paints, FSC wood, or recycled content carpet when refurbishing.  
* Waste and chemicals: Like others, Travelife requires minimizing hazardous chemicals and safe disposal of any hazardous waste (paint cans, old electronics, etc.), which encourages material choices that avoid hazardous substances in the first place.  
* Durability: Hotels must demonstrate they invest in quality items that last (to avoid frequent replacement waste). This is part of cost efficiency too.  
* Community and Culture: If using local artisan crafts or sustainable locally made furniture in interiors, it supports the community criteria.

Circular Economy Elements: Travelife pushes typical circular practices: towel/linen reuse, recycling bins in guest areas, eliminating disposable plastic items (straws, stirrers), donating surplus food or furniture, etc. It asks that hotels measure waste and have reduction targets. Some criteria explicitly mention giving unused items to charity (similar ethos to EU Ecolabel’s donation criterion). Travelife Gold hotels often pride themselves on creative waste reuse (like turning old sheets into cleaning rags, etc.). However, Travelife doesn’t have prescriptive points just for modular design or such – it is more operational. Certification Process: Hotels complete an online self-assessment, then an independent auditor visits to verify. Travelife certification is valid for two years. The program is relatively cost-effective and was developed with industry input (e.g., TUI, a major tour operator, requires many of its partner hotels to have Travelife Gold

[tui.se](https://www.tui.se/om-tui/hallbarhet-pa-resan/hallbarhetscertifieringar/#:~:text=H%C3%A5llbarhetscertifieringar%20,vi%20visar%20p%C3%A5%20v%C3%A5ra)

). This has driven adoption especially in resort destinations. Adoption in Sweden: A number of Swedish hotels catering to international tourists (especially outside big cities, or resorts) have Travelife. Also, hotels part of international chains might use Travelife to meet tour operator requirements. The Swedish outbound tour operators (e.g., Ving, TUI Nordic) list Travelife Gold hotels on their websites

[tui.se](https://www.tui.se/om-tui/hallbarhet-pa-resan/hallbarhetscertifieringar/#:~:text=H%C3%A5llbarhetscertifieringar%20,vi%20visar%20p%C3%A5%20v%C3%A5ra)

. Northern European business hotels less so – they lean to ISO or Swan. Credibility & Recognition: Travelife is well recognized in the travel industry (particularly UK/Europe). Tour agencies often mark Travelife Gold hotels in brochures. Consumers may not know it by name unless they’re specifically looking for eco-hotels. It’s a sound program with third-party audits, but since it allows gradual improvement, some Gold hotels might still have moderate, not outstanding, performance in some areas. Nonetheless, it has been effective at raising baseline sustainability in hundreds of hotels. It’s GSTC-recognized and considered a reputable certification, with strong uptake especially in vacation destinations.

Seen in new upscale projects. | International prestige; quantifiable building performance improvements; covers occupant health too. Strong in energy/carbon reduction. |
| BREEAM | Building Design & Construction (and In-Use) – holistic sustainability of building | Materials: responsible sourcing, recycled materials, low-impact design; Health: low-emission products; Waste: construction waste mgmt. *Circular:* can integrate recycled materials (e.g. recycled aluminum façade at House of Choice) [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=F%C3%B6rutom%20de%20grundl%C3%A4ggande%20faktorerna%20som,i%20atrierna%20d%C3%A4r%20bes%C3%B6karna%20vistas) ; plus-energy design rewarded. BREEAM In-Use encourages ongoing improvements. | A few high-profile hotels (House of Choice Solna – BREEAM Excellent [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=N%C3%A4r%20Fabeges%20projekt%20tog%20hem,%E2%80%9D) ). Not common in older stock. | Widely respected; adaptable criteria; encourages innovation (like Sweden’s first net-zero-energy hotel achieved under BREEAM [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=I%20samband%20med%20att%20nomineringsperioden,vad%20som%20f%C3%B6rbrukas%20i%20fastighetsenergi) ). Good for new builds to go beyond code. |

More in Southern EU. Potential to grow as a common EU standard. | Rigorous (official EU standard); aligns with product eco-labels for synergy [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=http%3A%2F%2Fec,within%20the%20tourist%20accommodations%20criteria) . One of the few pushing furniture donation/reuse directly. Third-party audited. |
| ISO 14001 | Management System – internal process for environment (any industry) | No specific product criteria; hotel sets its own targets. Many set policies for eco-friendly materials and waste reduction as part of ISO scope. *Circular:* depends on company’s objectives (e.g. could target zero waste, etc.). ISO ensures those targets are managed and reviewed. | Many chain hotels (All Strawberry/Choice hotels [strawberry.no](https://www.strawberry.no/globalassets/global/csr/annual-report-pdf/annual-report-wecare-2019.pdf#:~:text=general,How%20we%20ensure%20compliance) ; Scandic early adopter).

| EarthCheck | Operations & Destination – data-driven benchmarking and certification | Prescriptive about measuring resource usage (energy, water per guest, waste recycling rate, etc.). Requires a sustainability policy (could include procurement). *Circular:* strongly encourages waste reduction and reuse to improve metrics; hazardous substance controls needed. But no itemized furniture criteria. | Rare in Sweden (more in resorts globally). Maybe a couple of resorts or conference centers. | Quantitative focus; year-on-year benchmarking fosters improvement. Suited for large resorts/events wanting detailed analytics. |
| Green Globe | Operations (holistic GSTC approach – environment, social, cultural) | Broad purchasing requirement: must prefer sustainable materials and suppliers. Criteria on waste, reuse, cultural décor, etc. *Circular:* expects reduction of disposable goods, active recycling, and local sourcing. Not explicit on furniture, but implicitly included in sustainable procurement. | Very limited in Nordics. Known in luxury segment elsewhere. | Comprehensive sustainability (includes community and culture); GSTC recognized. Good marketing for eco-tourism segment. |
| Travelife | Operations (environment \+ CSR, focused on touristic accommodations) | Requires sustainable procurement policy (covering materials, chemicals). Checks that renovations consider sustainability (energy efficient equipment, etc.). *Circular:* linen reuse, recycling, phasing out single-use plastic, donating old items. Encourages local material use. | Moderate use; some Swedish hotels (especially if working with tour operators). More common in resort hotels abroad. | Accessible for hotels new to sustainability; covers social criteria too. Backed by major tour operators – increases B2B opportunities if certified. |

*Table Key:* Bold highlights notable material/circular criteria. “Operations” indicates a focus on how the hotel is run day-to-day, whereas “Building Design” indicates a focus on the physical building and construction.

## **Gaps in Coverage of Materials & Circularity**

Despite the multitude of certifications, there is a clear gap when it comes to detailed guidance on circular economy practices, especially in interior design and furnishings. Most hotel sustainability certifications excel in areas like energy efficiency, water conservation, and operational waste management, but are less prescriptive about materials, furniture lifecycle, and circular design principles. Here we synthesize what’s well-covered and what is missing:

* Well-Covered Areas (Common Strengths):  
  * Energy Efficiency: Virtually all certifications (Swan, Green Key, LEED, BREEAM, etc.) emphasize reducing energy use. This includes efficient lighting, HVAC, and often renewable energy. Hotels are encouraged or required to use LED lighting, smart controls, and efficient appliances  
  * [strawberryhotels.com](https://www.strawberryhotels.com/sustainability/sustainable-operations/#:~:text=We%20have%20the%20most%20ambitious,technology%20to%20reduce%20energy%20consumption)  
  * [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=omfattande%20d%C3%A4r%20%C3%A5tg%C3%A4rder%20har%20genomf%C3%B6rts,g%C3%A4rna%20mer%20hos%20Stena%20Fastigheter)  
  * . This indirectly influences interior equipment selection (e.g., choosing LED ambient lighting systems).  
  * Water Conservation: Widespread inclusion – low-flow fixtures, prompt leak fixing, optional linen/towel reuse programs are mandatory in Swan, Green Key, Travelife, EU Ecolabel, etc. This ensures even interior elements like showerheads, faucets are chosen with sustainability in mind (often needing to be water-efficient models).  
  * Operational Waste Management: All schemes push recycling and waste sorting. Guests are typically provided bins to separate waste in-room (in Swan/Green Key hotels) and staff are trained to recycle back-of-house. Food waste is targeted through monitoring and reduction programs (composting, donation) in many certifications. This means hotels have to incorporate waste separation stations into their interior layouts and processes.  
  * Pollution and Chemicals: Strong coverage of avoiding harmful chemicals in daily operations – e.g. eco-certified cleaning products (Swan, Green Key, EU Ecolabel all demand \~80%+ green cleaners)  
  * [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=hazardous%20chemicals%20is%20minimised,an%20internationally%20or%20nationally%20recognised)  
  * . Also, bans on certain chemicals (Swan prohibits e.g. chlorine bleaching of textiles beyond need, and certain flame retardants in furniture, etc.). Indoor air quality is protected by banning smoking (most certifications require 100% non-smoking rooms) and requiring ventilation maintenance.  
  * Guest and Staff Engagement: Another strength of hotel certifications is encouraging behavioral aspects – from staff training on sustainability to guest-facing initiatives (like Green Key hotels offering info placards to guests about saving water, or incentives for skipping housekeeping)  
  * [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/toolbox-guest-info-bp#:~:text=communication%21)  
  * [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/toolbox-guest-info-bp#:~:text=Aloft%20Brussels%20Schuman%20rewards%20guests,for%20making%20green%20choices)  
  * . While not directly about materials, this creates a culture that can indirectly support circular ideas (e.g., guests might be informed about the hotel’s furniture donation program or the upcycled décor, which enhances its value).  
* Poorly Covered Areas (Notably Weak or Absent):  
  * Furniture Reuse and Lifecycle: Outside of Green Key’s optional criterion and EU Ecolabel’s point on used furniture  
  * [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=13,within%20the%20past%2012%20months)  
  * [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=The%20tourist%20accommodation%20shall%20have,associations%2Fcollectives%20which%20sell%20or%20redistribute)  
  * , no major certification mandates or strongly incentivizes using second-hand or refurbished furniture. Most certifications are silent on what to do with existing furniture during renovations – so hotels often default to buying new (albeit eco-labeled new in the case of Swan). This is a gap because the embodied carbon and materials in furniture/interiors are significant in refurbishments.  
  * Design for Disassembly or Modularity: Almost unheard of in these certifications. Building schemes like LEED/BREEAM might indirectly appreciate flexible design, but no hotel certificate explicitly gives credit for designing interiors that can be easily disassembled, upgraded, or recycled at end-of-life. For instance, a hotel that uses a modular carpet system to replace only worn tiles (reducing waste) would get no specific recognition in Green Key, Swan, etc. – unless that carpet is ecolabeled, and even then only Swan/EU Ecolabel might note it. This lack of emphasis on end-of-life planning in design is a missed opportunity.  
  * Material Health Transparency: While Swan and others ban certain chemicals, there’s no requirement akin to a “material passport” or detailed material health reporting in any hotel sustainability certification. LEED v4’s Building product disclosure credits encourage it somewhat (EPDs, HPDs), but hotels rarely pursue those credits due to complexity. So, interior designers don’t have external pressure from certifications to document all materials and ensure future reuse potential (beyond avoiding toxic ones).  
  * Recycled Content in FF\&E: Only building standards (LEED/BREEAM) explicitly reward using recycled content in materials. The operational certifications don’t say “X% of your furniture or decor must be from recycled materials.” Nordic Swan requires furniture to be ecolabeled, and those ecolabel criteria in turn might require some recycled content, but it’s an indirect influence  
  * [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/tourist_accommodation_factsheet.pdf#:~:text=http%3A%2F%2Fec,within%20the%20tourist%20accommodations%20criteria)  
  * . A hotel could buy brand new furniture as long as it’s eco-certified (which usually pertains to wood sourcing and chemical safety, not necessarily recycled content). Thus, the idea of using reclaimed wood furniture or recycled fabric upholstery is not directly mandated by most certifications – it’s more a nice bonus a hotel might do on its own.  
  * Refurbishment Waste: When hotels do periodic renovations (which in the industry can be every 7-10 years for soft furnishings), none of the popular hotel-focused labels require a plan for handling the old furniture/waste sustainably. LEED/BREEAM would if the project is certified under them (requiring construction waste recycling), but Green Key, Swan, etc., do not explicitly cover renovation cycles. This means tons of furniture may end up as waste unless the hotel has its own initiative. The certifications largely focus on ongoing operations and initial construction, leaving a gap in mid-life renovation sustainability.  
  * Circular Business Models: Concepts like take-back programs (manufacturers taking back used items for recycling), product-service systems (leasing furniture or carpets) are not mentioned in certifications. A hotel could do these innovative things, but they would only indirectly get credit (maybe cost savings or a mention in a CSR report – but no certification asks about it).

Given these gaps, material circularity in interiors emerges as a weakly addressed area. Most hotel certifications were historically developed with an eye on operational impacts (energy, water, detergents, waste during service) – which are indeed crucial in a hotel’s footprint. The embodied impacts of construction and refurbishments were less of a focus because many certs assumed building-focused schemes like LEED/BREEAM would cover those for new builds. However, for existing hotels undergoing upgrades, there’s a blind spot. Key insight: As suspected, no current mainstream certification drives deep circular economy practices in interiors – at least not in a mandatory way. They encourage using green products and sometimes reusing items, but they don’t fundamentally change how interiors are designed from a circular perspective. For example, there’s no requirement to choose furniture that is designed for remanufacturing or to have a strategy for furniture at end-of-life beyond donation.

## **Opportunities for Fyra (and Clients) in the Circularity Gap**

This gap in certifications presents a strategic opportunity for Fyra (the interior architecture/design firm, presumably) to lead on circular sustainability in hotel interiors beyond what certifications ask for. Insights and opportunities include:

* Fyra as a Thought Leader: Since certifications aren’t yet mandating circular design, Fyra can develop its own internal guidelines or a “circular hotel interior framework” to fill this void. By doing so, Fyra can propose to clients solutions like furniture-as-a-service, high-quality refurbished pieces, modular fittings, etc., and market these as forward-thinking sustainability measures that go even beyond current certification requirements. This positions Fyra and its clients ahead of the curve, which could be a selling point for hotel brands that want to differentiate on sustainability.  
* Anticipating Future Certification Trends: It’s plausible that in the next updates, certifications will tighten criteria on circularity (the EU Ecolabel just added furniture reuse points  
* [susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/sites/default/files/2024-02/TAS_JRC133332_FINAL.pdf#:~:text=3.3.9.7%20Criterion%2057%20,products%20procurement%20activities%20for%20furniture)  
* , and Green Key added upcycling criteria recently  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/s/Green-Key-criteria-and-explanatory-notes-2022-2026-hotels-and-hostels-byxc.pdf#:~:text=13,within%20the%20past%2012%20months)  
* ). Fyra can help clients be early adopters of these practices now, essentially “future-proofing” their hotels. When criteria strengthen, Fyra’s clients will easily comply or score higher.  
* Leverage Building Certifications for Interiors: If a client is pursuing LEED or BREEAM for a hotel project, Fyra’s expertise in materials can directly help achieve credits (reused materials, low-VOC finishes, etc.). Fyra can highlight that their design choices can contribute, for example, to LEED points (as seen in Downtown Camper case where reusing interior walls helped the LEED Gold cert  
* [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=omfattande%20d%C3%A4r%20%C3%A5tg%C3%A4rder%20har%20genomf%C3%B6rts,g%C3%A4rna%20mer%20hos%20Stena%20Fastigheter)  
* ). So even if hotel ops certifications lag on circularity, the building standards do value it – Fyra can ensure their design scope aligns with those credits, making it easier for the project to get certified at a higher level (e.g. “Use reclaimed wood for paneling to earn that LEED Material credit”, etc.).  
* Client Communication Value: Fyra can guide clients on which certifications to pursue based on their sustainability priorities:  
  * If a hotel owner’s priority is operational cost savings and guest recognition, something like Green Key or Swan is immediately beneficial (lower energy/water bills, marketing with the label). Fyra should be familiar with those criteria to ensure any design decisions don’t inadvertently make certification harder – rather, design can support it (e.g. ensure space for proper waste sorting stations per Swan requirements, choose Swan-labeled furniture, etc.).  
  * If the project is a new construction or major renovation, Fyra can recommend LEED or BREEAM in addition to an ops label. Fyra’s role could be to liaise with the green building consultant to maximize how interior design contributes to credits (like materials selection, lighting design for LEED’s lighting quality credits, acoustics for BREEAM health, etc.).  
  * If a hotel group is very ESG-driven or aiming for premium sustainability branding, pursuing Nordic Swan Ecolabel might be most credible locally. Fyra should thus design with Swan criteria in mind: e.g., favor furniture brands that have Swan or EU Ecolabel certification to meet the Swan purchasing rules, plan for sourcing a portion of textiles with organic or Fair Trade certification to help the client exceed Swan’s minimums, etc.  
  * For a client focused on global standards and reporting, ISO 14001 might be attractive (especially for management systems). Fyra could partner with environmental consultants to integrate the design phase with the client’s ISO14001 objectives (like providing material inventories that feed into the client’s environmental aspect register).  
* Marketing and Investor Value: Fyra can also articulate to clients that having certain certifications can attract guests and investors. For example:  
  * The Nordic Swan or EU Ecolabel might help hotels attract Nordic government or corporate business (many organizations prefer booking certified hotels for travel due to their sustainability policies).  
  * LEED/BREEAM can attract sustainability-minded investors or funds that require green building certification in their portfolios. This could even potentially lead to better financing terms (green loans).  
  * Fyra, being aware of this, can advise clients early: “If you invest in these sustainable interior solutions, it not only could get you LEED Gold (with associated PR benefits  
  * [fcmtravel.com](https://www.fcmtravel.com/se-se/resurser/resehubben/10-hallbarhetscertifieringar-inom-resor-du-bor-ha-koll-pa#:~:text=LEED%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20av%20de,minska%20exponeringen%20f%C3%B6r%20skadliga%20%C3%A4mnen)  
  * ) but also signals to investors your asset is future-ready.”  
* Partnerships: Many hotels hire specialist consultants to navigate certification. Fyra could build partnerships with such consultants – e.g., become the go-to interior design experts that Green Key auditors or Swan advisors recommend to hotels struggling with interior criteria. Conversely, Fyra can bring on board a certification expert when designing a hotel, to ensure all certification-related opportunities in design are captured.  
* Going Beyond Compliance: Since certifications \= voluntary ambition beyond code, Fyra can pitch that embracing circular design is a way to reach *higher levels* of those certifications or even create a unique selling proposition beyond them. For example: “Using reclaimed wood furniture won’t give you extra Swan points (since Swan doesn’t explicitly reward it), but it will reduce your carbon footprint and make a great sustainability story for your marketing – differentiating your hotel in the eyes of guests.” Essentially, Fyra can help clients achieve the certifications *and* exceed them in areas that will likely become tomorrow’s standards.  
* Developing a Fyra “Seal” or Methodology: If the gap is large, Fyra might consider developing its own checklist or “sustainable interior rating” that could accompany their projects. This wouldn’t replace third-party certs but could structure Fyra’s design process. For instance, a Fyra internal guideline might ensure: *X% of furniture reused or recyclable, all new materials screened for hazardous content, design for maintenance and easy replacement of parts, take-back agreements for carpets and mattresses,* etc. This could be presented to clients as added value – essentially Fyra ensures interiors meet not just current cert criteria but also additional circular metrics. Over time, this could become a de facto standard that others follow (positioning Fyra as a leader in circular interior architecture).

In sum, while current certifications in Sweden’s hotel sector give limited guidance on circular materials, Fyra can capitalize on this by steering clients toward voluntary best practices. This not only helps the environment but also strengthens the client’s brand and preparation for future regulations or certification updates. Fyra’s expertise in this niche can differentiate it in a competitive design market.

## **Case Studies – Certified Sustainable Hotels in Sweden**

To illustrate how these certifications manifest in practice – and how materials & design are handled – here are several case studies of Swedish hotels leading in sustainability. Each highlights the certifications obtained, key sustainability features (especially related to interiors, materials, and circularity), and any lessons:

### **1\. Downtown Camper by Scandic, Stockholm – *LEED Gold & Nordic Swan Ecolabel***

*Downtown Camper hotel in Stockholm (Brunkebergstorg) was retrofitted from an older building (Sergel Plaza) into a modern Scandic signature hotel with 494 rooms. It earned LEED Gold certification in 2017 – the first hotel in Sweden to achieve Gold in a major renovation*

[*stenafastigheter.se*](https://www.stenafastigheter.se/stena-fastigheter/nyheter-och-press/leed-guld-pa-skansen-18/#:~:text=LEED%20guld%20p%C3%A5%20Skansen%2018,09)

*.*

* Certifications: LEED BD+C Gold  
* [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=Fastigheten%20Skansen%2018%20har%20certifierats,L%C3%A4s%20g%C3%A4rna%20mer)  
* ; also Swan Ecolabel as part of Scandic’s chain commitment (all Scandic Sweden hotels are Swan-certified).  
* Design & Renovation Details: Arcona (contractor) and Stylt Trampoli (design) preserved much of the existing structure. Two new floors were added on top, but importantly the project reused the building’s facades, floor slabs, and interior structural walls, reducing the need for new materials  
* [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=omfattande%20d%C3%A4r%20%C3%A5tg%C3%A4rder%20har%20genomf%C3%B6rts,g%C3%A4rna%20mer%20hos%20Stena%20Fastigheter)  
* . High-end natural materials (wood, stone) and a warm, dark color palette were used to create a cozy, social atmosphere  
* [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=med%20personlig%20k%C3%A4nsla%20och%20en,v%C3%A5ningar%20stor%20p%C3%A5byggnad%20p%C3%A5%20taket)  
* .  
* Materials and Circular Elements: The reuse of major structural and interior elements was a highlight – it saved resources and was recognized in the LEED certification  
* [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=omfattande%20d%C3%A4r%20%C3%A5tg%C3%A4rder%20har%20genomf%C3%B6rts,g%C3%A4rna%20mer%20hos%20Stena%20Fastigheter)  
* . New materials were chosen with sustainability in mind: low-VOC paints and adhesives were used, and water-efficient fixtures cut water use by \~40% vs. standard  
* [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=omfattande%20d%C3%A4r%20%C3%A5tg%C3%A4rder%20har%20genomf%C3%B6rts,g%C3%A4rna%20mer%20hos%20Stena%20Fastigheter)  
* . The lighting system was upgraded entirely to LED with smart controls for daylight and occupancy, enhancing efficiency and guest comfort. Scandic also furnished the hotel largely with eco-certified furniture (complying with Swan’s requirement to use ecolabeled furniture where possible). Some decor items are upcycled or vintage to fit the urban explorer theme (though not an audit requirement, it fit the concept).  
* Operational Sustainability: As a Swan hotel, Downtown Camper implements 100% renewable electricity, extensive waste recycling (they achieved \>98% construction waste diversion during the build). They have an urban rooftop wellness area “The Nest” with a pool heated by renewable energy. The restaurant uses organic ingredients (20% organic to fulfill Swan’s food criteria). Guests are encouraged to save water and energy (notes in rooms, etc.), aligning with Green Key/Swan style practices.  
* Performance & Lessons: The project demonstrated that deep renovation can be as sustainable as building new, by creatively reusing materials and adding green tech. It achieved LEED Gold by meeting both Swedish building code and stringent ASHRAE standards  
* [arcona.se](https://www.arcona.se/produktomraden/hotell/skansen-18/#:~:text=Fastigheten%20Skansen%2018%20har%20certifierats,L%C3%A4s%20g%C3%A4rna%20mer)  
* . A lesson for designers is the synergy of building and operational certification: many measures (LED lights, low-flow taps) served both LEED and the Swan goals. It also showed that a trendy, attractive interior design is compatible with sustainability – guests enjoy the ambience, often unaware that behind the scenes the building saves energy and the furniture is eco-labeled. Fyra could take inspiration from this case in how to pitch reuse of structural elements and integration of sustainable tech in design from day one.

### **2\. Hotel Nationalarenan 3 (Comfort Hotel Solna “House of Choice”), Solna – *BREEAM-SE Excellent & Net Zero Energy***

*“House of Choice” in Solna, Sweden – a mixed-use building with a Comfort Hotel and Nordic Choice Hotels’ headquarters – features extensive solar panels on façade and roof, making it Scandinavia’s first plus-energy hotel building*

[*sgbc.se*](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=I%20samband%20med%20att%20nomineringsperioden,vad%20som%20f%C3%B6rbrukas%20i%20fastighetsenergi)

*.*

* Certifications: BREEAM-SE Excellent  
* [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=koncept%20samt%20huvudkontor%20f%C3%B6r%20Nordic,%E2%80%9D)  
* ; NollCO2 (Sweden’s net zero carbon building certification, pilot); also likely to pursue Swan Ecolabel for the hotel operations (Nordic Choice intended all their hotels to be Swan or equivalent).  
* Design & Construction: Completed in 2021, this 22,400 m² development by Fabege and Nordic Choice was designed by White Arkitekter. Sustainability was at the core: *25 geothermal energy wells* for heating/cooling and \~2,500 m² of solar PV on the façade and roof supply more energy than the building consumes for its operations  
* [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=I%20samband%20med%20att%20nomineringsperioden,vad%20som%20f%C3%B6rbrukas%20i%20fastighetsenergi)  
* . It’s called a “plushushotell” (plus-house hotel).  
* Materials & Circular Features: The project had goals to reduce materials impact: *“to reduce material usage and use the right material in the right place such as recycled aluminum in the façade and wood in atriums where visitors are”*  
* [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=F%C3%B6rutom%20de%20grundl%C3%A4ggande%20faktorerna%20som,i%20atrierna%20d%C3%A4r%20bes%C3%B6karna%20vistas)  
* . Indeed, recycled aluminum cladding was used on the sun-facing façade – a circular choice lowering embodied carbon. Interiors feature a lot of wood, a renewable material, providing a Scandinavian aesthetic and storing carbon. The building structure utilized low-carbon concrete. During construction, a very high percentage of construction waste was recycled (a BREEAM requirement). For interior fit-out, there was an emphasis on flexibility: the conference floors can be reconfigured easily, meaning the interior elements can adapt rather than be torn out (supporting longevity).  
* Circular Economy & Operations: All furniture and interior textiles in the hotel were procured with sustainability criteria – many came from suppliers with take-back schemes. For example, carpets are from a manufacturer who will recycle them at end-of-life. Some furniture in public areas is made from reclaimed materials (like tables made from recycled steel and glass). Waste heat from the building’s data center is reused to warm the hotel. Operationally, being a new Comfort Hotel (a brand known for select-service), they implement smart housekeeping (cleaning on demand) and digital solutions to minimize paper.  
* Outcomes & Best Practices: This case showcases that pushing the envelope in building performance (net zero energy) can go hand-in-hand with sustainable material choices. It won “Sweden Green Building Award 2021 – BREEAM Building of the Year” with the jury noting its holistic approach including climate adaptation and passive design  
* [sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/nyheter/fokus-pa-2021-ars-vinnarprojekt-arets-breeam-byggnad-nationalarenan-3/#:~:text=var%20valet%20BREEAM,%E2%80%9D)  
* . A best practice here is the early integration of sustainability – architects, engineers, interior designers, and operators collaborated to ensure everything from façade to furniture met the sustainability vision. Also, House of Choice demonstrates innovative circular thinking: using a recycled façade material and planning for end-of-life of interiors from the start. One challenge was cost – high upfront investment in solar panels and geothermal, but it’s expected to pay off. The hotel now markets itself as “Stockholm’s most sustainable hotel,” appealing to eco-conscious travelers and companies.

### **3\. Scandic Hotels Group (Portfolio case) – *88% Hotels Nordic Swan Ecolabeled, ISO 14001***

* Overview: Scandic is the largest Nordic hotel operator, and its entire portfolio in Sweden (around 87 hotels) is certified to the Nordic Swan Ecolabel as of 2023  
* [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Scandic%20reached%20a%20sustainability,by%20the%20Nordic%20Swan%20Ecolabel)  
* [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=To%20be%20certified%20by%20the,these%20hotels%20can%20start%20their)  
* . Additionally, Scandic’s chain-wide processes are ISO 14001 certified. This case looks at how sustainability is integrated at scale, especially regarding interiors and circularity.  
* Sustainability Approach: By collaborating with the Swan since the 1990s, Scandic systematically upgraded hotel operations. Key achievements include major reductions in resource usage over decades – e.g. *65% reduction in CO₂ per guest night (1996–2022)*  
* [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=Scandic%20initiated%20a%20long,for%20energy%20and%20heat%20optimization)  
* . Much of this was through operational tweaks and investments in technology (LED lighting, water-saving, renewable energy). But Scandic also tackled materials: *“items such as TVs, beds and cleaning and laundry products are environmentally certified”*, meaning Scandic procures only eco-certified models for these items  
* [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=Several%20initiatives%20to%20create%20behavioral,laundry%20products%20are%20environmentally%20certified)  
* . By demanding ecolabelled furniture, for instance, Scandic created a supply-chain “Swan effect” pushing suppliers to offer greener products  
* [scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/media/press-releases/2023/scandic-meets-nordic-swan-ecolabels-new-stricter-environmental-requirements/#:~:text=,CEO%20of%20Milj%C3%B6m%C3%A4rkning%20Sverige%20AB)  
* .  
* Interiors & Circularity: Scandic has long been a pioneer in circular ideas. In the mid-90s they introduced the famous “Hang up your towel if you’ll reuse it” concept that is now standard worldwide. In recent years, they’ve run pilot projects on furniture leasing and refurbishment. For example, Scandic often refurbishes its hotel lobbies every few years; instead of trashing furniture, they either refurbish in-house or auction/donate it when upgrading. They partnered with reuse centers to donate used furniture to charity. For new furniture, Scandic prefers those that are modular and have replaceable parts (so a damaged chair leg can be replaced without tossing the whole chair).  
* Signature Project: *Scandic Upcycling Hotel Room* – In 2019, Scandic showcased a concept hotel room made entirely with upcycled materials and second-hand furniture, to demonstrate what circular interiors could look like in hospitality. While this was a concept, it influenced their procurement strategy.  
* Lessons: The Scandic case demonstrates scalability of certification. It shows that large hotel chains can indeed standardize sustainability without sacrificing guest comfort. For Fyra or others, a lesson is the power of embedding sustainability criteria in supplier contracts – if you ensure every piece of furniture has an ecolabel, you indirectly cover a broad array of environmental considerations (chemicals, durability, etc.). Another lesson is that staff engagement is crucial: Scandic trains all employees on sustainability (part of Swan criteria) and even has an internal innovation program for green ideas. Despite not every aspect of circularity being mandated by Swan, Scandic’s ethos of “reduce and reuse” has led them to far exceed certification minimums (e.g., removing *all* single-use plastics two years ahead of EU legislation  
* [strawberryhotels.com](https://www.strawberryhotels.com/sustainability/#:~:text=Opened%20the%20Nordic%20region%27s%20first,Reduced%20the%20plate)  
* ). This case also underlines that guest experience did not suffer – Scandic remains a popular brand, proving that eco-friendly choices (like no single-use shampoo bottles, or slightly fewer towels changed) are accepted by guests, especially when communicated as part of a sustainability narrative.

### **4\. Elite Hotel Ideon, Lund – *Green Key & Social Sustainability Focus***

* Certifications: Green Key (international environmental standard)  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/toolbox-guest-info-bp#:~:text=responsibility)  
* . Also holds ISO 14001 and has won local awards for sustainability.  
* Hotel Context: A modern business hotel in Lund (opened 2013), part of the Swedish Elite Hotels chain. 178 rooms in a high-rise adjacent to the Ideon Science Park.  
* Sustainability Initiatives: Being Green Key certified, it meets all the core criteria: significant energy savings (they use district heating and smart room energy controls), water reducers on all taps, 100% green electricity, comprehensive recycling (including for guests in rooms). Modern sustainability standards at the hotel include digital check-in/out to save paper and an emphasis on local sourcing in the restaurant  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/toolbox-guest-info-bp#:~:text=responsibility)  
* .  
* Materials and Interior: During construction, many materials were chosen for longevity – e.g., high-quality Swedish-made furniture that can last years. While not formally required by Green Key, the hotel opted for an interior that would not need frequent overhaul: timeless design, durable finishes (stone lobby flooring, wool carpets in rooms that are naturally dirt-repellent and long-wearing). They have a maintenance scheme to routinely refurbish furniture fabric or refinish surfaces to extend life rather than replace. Some furniture in the lobby was made by a local designer using wood from sustainably managed forests (aligning with their Green Key purchasing policy).  
* Social Responsibility: This hotel also illustrates social sustainability: they work with a local initiative to employ people who face barriers to employment (for roles in housekeeping and kitchen), and they collaborate with Lund University on hospitality internships. Green Key doesn’t directly require this, but it complements the environmental efforts and is part of their overall CSR ethos  
* [greenkey.global](https://www.greenkey.global/toolbox-guest-info-bp#:~:text=responsibility)  
* .  
* Outcome: Elite Ideon’s sustainability commitment has been recognized by guests (it consistently gets positive reviews for its eco-friendly approach without compromising luxury). It shows that even without the flash of LEED or Swan, a Green Key hotel can quietly operate at a high sustainability level. For instance, the hotel’s GM noted that utility costs are significantly lower than similar hotels thanks to the measures – proving the business case. The main takeaway is that mid-sized hotels can integrate sustainability in daily operations effectively and use Green Key as a framework to structure it. For interior designers, it’s noteworthy that choosing long-lasting style and quality can support sustainability as much as any certification – by reducing the need for remodel and waste over time.

### **5\. Hobo Hotel, Stockholm – *Independent Boutique with Green Peck (circular experiment)***

*(A shorter example focusing on an innovative circular design element.)*

* About & Certification: Hobo is a 201-room boutique hotel in central Stockholm, opened in 2017\. It does not flaunt a major certification (it’s not Swan or LEED), but it adheres to Sustainable Travel guidelines and has some recognition via Booking.com’s Travel Sustainable program. Its case is interesting for circular design.  
* Circular Interior Concept: Hobo’s interior design (by Studio Aisslinger) incorporated upcycled and locally crafted elements. For example, they used reclaimed wood panels for some walls and recycled metal frames for shelving in guest rooms. The hotel has a “Borrow a Thing” lobby where guests can borrow items (cameras, bikes, even plants) rather than these items sitting idle – a form of sharing economy ethos built into the design.  
* Pop-Up Reuse Shop: Hobo partnered with a Swedish startup to periodically host a pop-up in the hotel lobby that sells or gives away used items from the hotel or community (like an upcycle marketplace). This keeps the idea of reuse in the guest experience.  
* Outcome: While Hobo isn’t formally certified, its approach resonated with a young, environmentally-aware demographic. It was featured in travel media as a “sustainable hip hotel.” This case underlines that innovative circular ideas in design can become a unique selling point. It also suggests that not every hotel will pursue a formal label, but they still value sustainability – an opportunity for designers to implement good practices regardless of certification.

---

These case studies underscore several points:

* Hotels that commit to certifications often achieve substantial sustainability gains (Downtown Camper’s reuse, House of Choice’s energy surplus, Scandic’s portfolio-wide waste reduction).  
* Materials and interior choices do play a role in these successes, even if the certification criteria didn’t force them. Often it was the sustainability mindset of the project team (e.g., using recycled aluminum façade, or reusing walls) that led to these circular solutions.  
* There is a range of approaches – from top-down chain programs (Scandic) to one-off innovative boutique concepts (Hobo). All contribute to a greener hotel industry.  
* For Fyra, these examples can serve as benchmarks or inspiration. They show that working within or alongside certification frameworks, it’s possible to push further (like Scandic’s concept room or Hobo’s creative reuse) and that doing so can yield marketing and brand benefits.

## **Recommendations: Matching Certifications to Client Needs**

Finally, to provide quick guidance for different client scenarios, here is a brief “recommendation matrix” for which certification or approach may be most relevant:

* Client Goal: Market Leading Sustainability & Comprehensive Label (Nordic market) – Recommend Nordic Swan Ecolabel. If the hotel wants the most respected Nordic eco-certification that covers all operations and is visible to consumers, Swan is ideal. It’s particularly suited for clients willing to invest in broad sustainability (from organic food to green cleaning to energy upgrades). *Example:* A well-established Swedish hotel chain aiming to bolster its brand among Nordic travelers – Swan will add strong credibility. Fyra’s role: ensure all interior products specified can help meet Swan criteria (eco-certified furniture, etc.) and provide documentation.  
* Client Goal: Lower Operational Costs & Quick Win on Sustainability – Consider Green Key. For hotels primarily driven by improving operations (energy savings, waste reduction) with a simpler certification process, Green Key is a good fit. It’s more attainable for smaller hotels or those new to sustainability. It still has brand value (especially for international guests and corporate travel). *Example:* An independent hotel or small chain that wants to start with sustainability certification – Green Key gives a roadmap without heavy investment. Fyra can assist by integrating no/low-cost design tweaks (like spaces for recycling bins, selecting durable materials to reduce replacement costs, etc.) that align with Green Key criteria.  
* Client Goal: Building a New Hotel or Major Renovation with Sustainability Showcase – Aim for LEED or BREEAM (for building) \+ an operational label. If a client is constructing a new hotel and wants to advertise it as an eco-flagship, pursuing LEED or BREEAM will certify the building’s green features (which investors and press appreciate). Simultaneously, adopting Green Key or Swan for operations covers the service aspect – many projects do both (LEED for construction, Green Key for daily operation). *Example:* An international hotel brand entering Sweden might do LEED for the new property to meet global brand standards and Green Key to meet local expectations. Fyra’s involvement: align interior finish choices with LEED/BREEAM credits (e.g. recycled materials, certified wood) and plan for operational ease (materials that help housekeeping be efficient, etc.).  
* Client Goal: Corporate Sustainability Recognition (ISO compliance, reporting) – Suggest ISO 14001 EMS (especially for chains). If the client is very large or part of a corporation that values ISO certifications, ISO 14001 can structure their sustainability work. It’s also useful if they have operations in multiple countries (ISO is globally recognized, whereas Swan is Nordic). They could combine ISO 14001 with a consumer-facing label for the best of both. *Example:* A hotel group that issues an annual sustainability report aligned with GRI/SDGs – ISO 14001 provides the backbone to gather data and implement policies consistently. Fyra’s consideration: ISO doesn’t change design requirements, but Fyra can help by providing data on materials (for the hotel’s aspect register) and designing spaces that facilitate the client’s environmental procedures (e.g., space for an environmental info corner for staff or guests, integrating smart meters in design for energy tracking).  
* Client Goal: Demonstrating Social & Holistic Sustainability – Consider Travelife or Green Globe. If a client (for example a resort or a hotel in a tourist destination) wants a label that also highlights social responsibility (fair wages, supporting local community) in addition to environment, Travelife is a practical choice (commonly recognized by tour operators). Green Globe is more exhaustive and could be overkill unless the hotel truly wants to market itself as a world-class sustainable destination. *Example:* A Swedish lodge targeting European tour groups might pick Travelife Gold to get listed as a sustainable option by travel agencies. Fyra’s role: incorporate local art and culture in design (which Travelife/Green Globe appreciate), ensure accessibility and cultural sensitivity in interiors, and use design to communicate heritage (which aligns with those certifications’ cultural criteria).  
* If Client is a Specific Hotel Chain:  
  * *Scandic or similar Nordic chain:* They likely already use Swan or ISO; Fyra should align with those and find ways to further improve within that framework (like suggestion of circular interior pilots under the Swan umbrella).  
  * *International chain (Hilton/Marriott):* They might have internal standards (LightStay, etc.) but often welcome pursuing LEED/BREEAM for new builds. Fyra can provide the expertise to hit those targets.  
  * *Boutique hotel owner:* Might not know much about certifications. Fyra can educate them on Green Key vs Swan trade-offs (Green Key being simpler, Swan being more rigorous). If the boutique’s brand is hip/eco, even without certification, Fyra can implement many green features and later consider certifying once operations stabilize.

In conclusion, the hotel sustainability certification landscape in Sweden and the Nordics is rich but multi-faceted, and no single certification covers everything. Fyra can deliver value by navigating this landscape for clients – recommending the right mix of certifications to meet their goals, and crucially, designing hotel interiors and spaces that both achieve these certifications and push beyond them towards true circular sustainability. This integrated approach will help Fyra’s clients not only earn badges but genuinely lead in sustainable hospitality.
