# **Byggvarubedömningen (BVB) – Circular Economy Criteria: Comprehensive Research Report for Fyra**

## **Executive Summary**

Byggvarubedömningen (BVB) is Sweden's established construction product assessment system that evaluates products based on chemical content and lifecycle aspects, but currently has **limited integration of comprehensive circular economy criteria**. While BVB addresses some circular principles—notably recycled content (≥50% for "Recommended" rating) and end-of-life recyclability (≥70%)—critical gaps exist for hotel projects seeking robust circularity strategies.[byggvarubedomningen+4](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf)​  
**Critical finding for Fyra**: BVB does not have an established pathway to assess reclaimed or used products. This presents both a challenge and an advocacy opportunity. For hotel specifications, Fyra will need to develop **equivalency frameworks** that demonstrate environmental benefits of reused products through alternative documentation such as embodied carbon calculations, third-party certifications, or performance testing.[sintef+2](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/rebus/assessment-of-construction-products-for-reuse/)​  
The system is voluntary but widely adopted among Sweden's major construction and real estate actors, with over 30,000 assessed products in the database. However, adoption in the hospitality sector varies significantly—while major chains like Scandic mandate ecolabeled furniture and textiles through Nordic Swan requirements, BVB is less consistently required compared to other sectors.[byggvarubedomningen+3](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/news/news/driven-by-byggvarubedomningens-criteria/)​

## **1\. BVB System – Fundamental Understanding**

## **1.1 System Overview and Administration**

**What is BVB?**  
Byggvarubedömningen is a non-profit economic association (ekonomisk förening) developed by Sweden's construction industry to assess building products based on health and environmental criteria. The system consists of two core components:[ivl+2](https://www.ivl.se/press/nyheter/2009-11-25-enighet-om-utfasning-av-farliga-amnen-i-byggprodukter.html)​

1. **Product database**: Over 30,000 assessed products with transparent ratings[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/news/news/driven-by-byggvarubedomningens-criteria/)​  
2. **Logbook tool**: Enables project-level documentation and traceability of installed products and their chemical contents[bransch.trafikverket+1](https://bransch.trafikverket.se/for-dig-i-branschen/miljo---for-dig-i-branschen/Material-och-kemiska-produkter/oka-takten--kemikalieinformation-nu/mojliggor/bygga-giftfritt-och-stodja-giftfria-produktval/)​

**Who administers BVB?**  
BVB is owned and operated by a consortium of leading Swedish construction industry stakeholders, though it is functionally independent. IVL Svenska Miljöinstitutet (Swedish Environmental Research Institute) plays a key governance role and is the principal owner of the related BASTA system, with which BVB has aligned chemical content criteria.[byggvarubedomningen+4](https://byggvarubedomningen.se/)​  
**Voluntary vs. Mandatory Status**  
BVB is entirely voluntary. However, it has achieved de facto market influence through:[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.se/)​

1. Major property owners and developers specifying BVB-rated products in procurement[byggforetagen+1](https://byggforetagen.se/app/uploads/2020/01/Materialdatabaserokt2012.pdf)​  
2. Integration into Sweden's Miljöbyggnad certification system (BVB documentation satisfies certain material criteria)[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/confidential-information-in-our-assessments/)​  
3. Industry-wide recognition as a credibility benchmark for sustainable construction[eco-institut](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/)​

**Adoption Rate in Swedish Construction**  
While exact adoption statistics are not published, BVB's reach is substantial:

1. **10,000+ logbooks** document product usage across Sweden's largest construction projects[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/about-us/industry-report-2024/)​  
2. Major contractors (Skanska, NCC, Peab) and property owners use BVB systematically[formas+1](https://formas.se/download/18.462d60ec167c69393b91df5e/1549956093947/Co_operation_for_sustainability.pdf)​  
3. **74% reduction** in hazardous substance use in Swedish buildings between 2018-2024, attributed partly to BVB influence[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/about-us/industry-report-2025/)​

## **1.2 Rating Structure**

BVB uses a **traffic light system** with three rating levels:[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/)​  
**Recommended (Green)**

1. All chemical content criteria assessed as "Recommended"  
2. No lifecycle criteria assessed as "To be avoided"  
3. At least 50% of relevant lifecycle criteria assessed as "Recommended"[byggvarubedomningen+2](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/moqncoeq/criteria-40.pdf)​

**Accepted (Yellow)**

1. No content criteria assessed as "To be avoided"  
2. No lifecycle criteria assessed as "To be avoided"[byggvarubedomningen+2](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf)​

**To be avoided (Red)**

1. One or more content criteria assessed as "To be avoided," OR  
2. One or more lifecycle criteria assessed as "To be avoided"[byggvarubedomningen+2](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/moqncoeq/criteria-40.pdf)​

**Assessment Process**  
Manufacturers or suppliers apply for product assessment by submitting:

1. Building Product Declaration (eBVD2015 format) detailing chemical composition[byggvarubedomningen+2](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/)​  
2. Lifecycle documentation (production processes, packaging, end-of-life options)[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/)​  
3. Third-party test reports where applicable (emissions, durability, etc.)[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/)​

BVB's assessors—comprising experts from member organizations—review submissions against approximately **30 chemical content criteria** and **6 lifecycle criteria**. Processing time:[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.se/bedomningar/)​

1. New assessment: 10 working days (preliminary result)[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/get-started-with-byggvarubedomningen/)​  
2. Reassessment: 20 working days[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/)​

**Who Can Rate Products?**  
Only manufacturers or their authorized representatives can apply for BVB assessment. Third-party assessment by architects or specifiers is not permitted—BVB assessors conduct all evaluations internally.[byggvarubedomningen+2](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/get-started-with-byggvarubedomningen/)​  
**Cost of Assessment**

1. **Annual subscription**: Required for manufacturers to submit products; pricing not publicly disclosed but described as cost-recovery model[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/pricelist-assessments/)​  
2. **Standard assessment**: Included in subscription[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/pricelist-assessments/)​  
3. **Confidential (NDA) assessment**: 6,000 SEK per product[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/)​  
4. **NDA reassessment**: 1,000 SEK[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/pricelist-assessments/)​  
5. **Database access** (for specifiers/buyers): Free for search; project logbook tools require subscription[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/pricelist-assessments/)​

## **1.3 Hospitality Sector Usage**

**Adoption in Hotel Projects**  
BVB adoption in hospitality is **less systematic** than in commercial office or residential sectors:

1. **Scandic Hotels**: Over 95% of Scandic's 238+ hotels are Nordic Swan Ecolabel certified, which requires purchasing ecolabeled furniture and textiles. While Nordic Swan does not mandate BVB specifically, there is overlap—Swan criteria reference similar chemical restrictions and lifecycle thinking[nordic-swan-ecolabel+6](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/4a4297/contentassets/2023a5e215d04b25b0b1d205c789c935/consultation-comments_031_furniture-and-fitments-031_norwegian.pdf)​  
2. **Strawberry (former Nordic Choice Hotels)**: Limited public documentation of BVB requirements, though the group has committed to sustainability through other frameworks (Mews PMS for operational efficiency)[hftp+2](https://www.hftp.org/news/4119554/strawberry-migrates-their-100th-hotel-onto-mews-hospitality-cloud)​  
3. **General market**: BVB is more frequently specified in **office fit-outs and public buildings** than hotels. Hotels tend to prioritize:  
4. Nordic Swan Ecolabel (holistic certification)[hotelmanagement-network+2](https://www.hotelmanagement-network.com/news/scandic-nordic-swan-ecolabel/)​  
5. OEKO-TEX for textiles (chemical safety)[1concier](https://www.1concier.com/production-and-sustainability-certifications-in-the-hotel-industry/)​  
6. Fire safety compliance (EN 13501-1 Euroclass)[measurlabs+3](https://measurlabs.com/blog/en-13501-1-fire-classification-performance-classes-and-criteria/)​

**Investor/Bank Requirements**  
No evidence found of Swedish banks or hotel investors explicitly requiring BVB ratings. However, environmental certifications (Miljöbyggnad, BREEAM-SE, Nordic Swan) increasingly influence financing terms for sustainable construction.[odr.chalmers+2](https://odr.chalmers.se/bitstreams/41d80c70-dc6d-447e-8740-4cf5abf5a06a/download)​  
**"Nice to Have" vs. "Must Have"**  
For hotels: **Nice to have** in most cases, **must have** only when:

1. Pursuing Miljöbyggnad Gold/Silver and lacking alternative documentation[se2050+1](https://se2050.org/miljobyggnad-mb-version-3-1-sweden-green-building-council/)​  
2. Client (property owner) has internal BVB mandate[byggforetagen+1](https://byggforetagen.se/app/uploads/2020/01/Materialdatabaserokt2012.pdf)​  
3. Seeking differentiation through verified low-emission interiors[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/ulnmlnpf/bvb-branschrapport-2025-eng-1.pdf)​

## **2\. Circular Economy Criteria in BVB**

## **2.1 Overview: Has BVB Integrated Circular Economy Principles?**

**Partially, but incompletely.** BVB's lifecycle criteria address some circular economy aspects—recycled content, recyclability, and reuse potential—but lack comprehensive coverage of emerging circularity strategies such as modular design, reparability, product-as-a-service, or reclaimed product assessment.[byggvarubedomningen+4](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/3mmluv5k/criteria-60.pdf)​  
BVB's lifecycle assessment covers six areas:[byggvarubedomningen+3](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/ofvf2ovc/criteria-70.pdf)​

1. **Materials and resources** (recycled content, sustainable wood)  
2. **Manufacturing** (emissions, energy use)  
3. **Packaging** (recyclability, producer responsibility)  
4. **Use phase** (emissions, durability)  
5. **Waste and demolition** (reuse, recycling potential)  
6. **Indoor environment** (VOC emissions, health impacts)

Only criteria **1, 3, and 5** directly relate to circular economy principles.

## **2.2 Material Reuse and Recycled Content**

**Criterion 1.2: Proportion of Recycled Material**[byggvarubedomningen+2](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/yzejxznw/criteria-50.pdf)​  
RatingThresholdNotes  
**Recommended**  
≥50% recycled material by weight  
Only **post-consumer** material qualifies  
**Accepted**  
\<50% recycled material OR data lacking  
Pre-consumer waste (production scrap) excluded  
**To be avoided**  
N/A  
Criterion cannot trigger "To be avoided"

**Key Details:**

1. **Post-consumer vs. pre-consumer**: BVB follows EU Waste Framework Directive definitions—only material that has "passed the consumer level" (i.e., been in use) counts as recycled content. Factory production waste does not qualify.[byggvarubedomningen+2](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/3mmluv5k/criteria-60.pdf)​  
2. **Documentation**: Manufacturers must specify recycled content percentage and source (pre- vs. post-consumer) in eBVD declaration[halton+1](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20ULA.pdf)​  
3. **Impact on overall rating**: Products with ≥50% recycled content can achieve "Recommended" for this criterion, contributing to overall rating (if chemical content also meets standards)[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/moqncoeq/criteria-40.pdf)​

**BVB does NOT:**

1. Differentiate scoring between recycled content levels (e.g., 50% vs. 90% both \= "Recommended")  
2. Incentivize increased recycled content beyond 50% threshold  
3. Address **quality** of recycled material (downcycled vs. closed-loop)

## **2.3 Reparability and Lifetime Extension**

**No explicit criteria** for product reparability, modular design, or design for disassembly.[byggvarubedomningen+3](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/ofvf2ovc/criteria-70.pdf)​  
While BVB assesses **durability** indirectly through use-phase criteria (e.g., wear resistance for flooring), it does not evaluate:

1. Availability of spare parts  
2. Ease of component replacement  
3. Modular construction enabling upgrades  
4. Manufacturer repair services or warranties

**Comparison to other systems:**

1. EU's emerging **reparability scoring** (for electronics, furniture) includes metrics like disassembly time, tool requirements, and spare part pricing[benelux+2](https://www.benelux.int/files/7915/2896/0920/FINAL_Report_Benelux.pdf)​  
2. **Cradle to Cradle** evaluates product design for material recovery cycles[getgreenbadger+2](https://getgreenbadger.com/cradle-to-cradle/)​  
3. **BVB's gap**: Does not incentivize design strategies that extend product life or enable refurbishment

## **2.4 Take-Back and End-of-Life Programs**

**Criterion 5.2: Recycling**[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/yzejxznw/criteria-50.pdf)​  
RatingThresholdNotes  
**Recommended**  
≥70% of product can be material recycled  
Based on current technology and infrastructure  
**Accepted**  
≥70% recyclable as fill material OR energy recovery OR installation waste systems exist  
Lower-quality recycling acceptable  
**To be avoided**  
\<70% recyclable OR data lacking  
Lack of documentation triggers red rating

**Take-Back Programs:**  
BVB documentation requests manufacturers to describe take-back or recycling systems for packaging and products, but:[byggbeslag+3](https://www.byggbeslag.se/documents/BVD_22030409.pdf)​

1. **No scoring weight** for take-back programs beyond general recyclability assessment  
2. Manufacturer take-back is **documented** but not explicitly rewarded with higher ratings  
3. Packaging producer responsibility (e.g., FTI Förpackningsinsamlingen membership) is noted but not scored[halton+1](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20ULA.pdf)​

**Example from research**: An artificial turf manufacturer highlighted their take-back program and recycling validation during BVB assessment, demonstrating that such programs are valued as supporting evidence but not standalone criteria.[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/news/news/driven-by-byggvarubedomningens-criteria/)​

## **2.5 Traceability and Transparency**

**Limited explicit criteria**, though documentation requirements indirectly promote transparency:  
**Material Passports/Product Documentation:**

1. BVB requires detailed eBVD2015 Building Product Declarations listing all substances \>0.1% by weight[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/moqncoeq/criteria-40.pdf)​  
2. Declarations must be updated every 5 years[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/moqncoeq/criteria-40.pdf)​  
3. Logbook system enables traceability of installed products over building lifetime[bransch.trafikverket+1](https://bransch.trafikverket.se/for-dig-i-branschen/miljo---for-dig-i-branschen/Material-och-kemiska-produkter/oka-takten--kemikalieinformation-nu/mojliggor/bygga-giftfritt-och-stodja-giftfria-produktval/)​

**Supply Chain Transparency:**  
BVB has introduced **Sustainable Supply Chain** criteria (separate assessment track launched 2020s), evaluating:[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.se/bedomningar/)​

1. Human rights compliance (UN Guiding Principles)  
2. Anti-corruption policies (UN Global Compact)  
3. Environmental management systems (ISO 14001\)[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.se/bedomningar/)​

However, supply chain assessment is **not mandatory** for chemical content/lifecycle rating and is a separate, optional certification layer.[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/)​  
**BVB does NOT require:**

1. Digital product passports (DPPs) aligned with EU's upcoming CPR requirements[sigmatechnology+2](https://sigmatechnology.com/articles/navigating-the-eus-digital-product-passport-for-construction/)​  
2. Blockchain or other immutable traceability systems[blueroominnovation](https://www.blueroominnovation.com/en/digital-passport-for-construction-materials/)​  
3. Full ingredient disclosure down to trace substances (100 ppm threshold vs. Declare's full disclosure)[aid+2](https://aid.co/declare-red-list-free-promoting-healthier-building-environments/)​

## **2.6 CRITICAL GAP: Reclaimed and Used Products**

**Can used/reclaimed products be BVB-rated?**  
**No established pathway exists**.[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/rebus/assessment-of-construction-products-for-reuse/)​  
BVB's assessment framework assumes **new manufactured products** with:

1. Known chemical composition from manufacturer declarations[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/)​  
2. Documented production processes[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/moqncoeq/criteria-40.pdf)​  
3. Predictable performance characteristics[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/)​

**Barriers for used products:**

1. **Unknown chemical content**: Older products may contain substances now banned (e.g., asbestos, lead, brominated flame retardants)[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf)​  
2. **Performance degradation**: Wear, aging, and contamination complicate assessment[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/rebus/assessment-of-construction-products-for-reuse/)​  
3. **Lack of manufacturer**: Reclaimed products often lack original manufacturer to submit assessment[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/get-started-with-byggvarubedomningen/)​  
4. **No testing framework**: BVB has not developed protocols for sampling/testing used materials[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/rebus/assessment-of-construction-products-for-reuse/)​

**Research gap identified:**  
SINTEF's research program on "Assessment of construction products for reuse" (referenced in ) is developing frameworks for testing and evaluating reclaimed materials, including:[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/rebus/assessment-of-construction-products-for-reuse/)​

1. Non-destructive or minimally invasive assessment procedures  
2. Sampling frequencies for heterogeneous batches  
3. Appropriate evaluation criteria for intended use  
4. Risk assessment for accepting materials with uncertain properties[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/rebus/assessment-of-construction-products-for-reuse/)​

**Implication for Fyra**: Specifications must create **"equivalent performance" pathways** for reclaimed products outside BVB framework (see Section 4 below).

## **3\. BVB in Practice – Hospitality Sector**

## **3.1 Product Category Coverage**

**Which product categories are most commonly BVB-rated?**  
Based on database analysis and industry reports:  
**High coverage (\>5,000 products):**

1. Paints and coatings[eco-institut+1](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/)​  
2. Flooring (vinyl, linoleum, carpet tiles, wood)[nordicsurface+1](https://nordicsurface.se/app/uploads/2021/05/Byggvarubedo%CC%88mningen_SBR_Nordicsurface-Produkt.pdf)​  
3. Insulation materials[eco-institut](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/)​  
4. Gypsum boards and panels[byggforetagen+1](https://byggforetagen.se/app/uploads/2020/01/Materialdatabaserokt2012.pdf)​  
5. Adhesives and sealants[byggforetagen+1](https://byggforetagen.se/app/uploads/2020/01/Materialdatabaserokt2012.pdf)​

**Moderate coverage (1,000-5,000 products):**

1. Ceiling tiles and systems[eco-institut](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/)​  
2. Window and door systems[eco-institut](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/)​  
3. HVAC components[wittur+1](https://www.wittur.com/es/sustainability/wittur-initiatives/hydra-landing-door-sustainability-assessed-by-bvb-sweden.aspx)​  
4. Textiles (primarily technical textiles, acoustic panels)[lintex+1](https://www.lintex.com/row/en/circular-products/)​

**Low coverage (\<1,000 products):**

1. **Furniture**: Limited coverage, especially upholstered furniture. Most furniture relies on Nordic Swan, Möbelfakta, or OEKO-TEX instead[gotessons+2](https://gotessons.com/dk/baeredygtighed/Et-bedre-produktvalg)​  
2. **Decorative textiles**: Curtains, upholstery fabrics, bedspreads—minimal BVB coverage[nordic-swan-ecolabel](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/4a4297/contentassets/2023a5e215d04b25b0b1d205c789c935/consultation-comments_031_furniture-and-fitments-031_norwegian.pdf)​  
3. **Lighting fixtures**: Very limited (mostly LED components, not complete luminaires)[diva-portal+1](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1874028/FULLTEXT01.pdf)​  
4. **Kitchen equipment**: Virtually absent[eco-institut](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/)​  
5. **Bathroom fixtures**: Minimal (some fittings, not complete systems)[eco-institut](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/)​

## **3.2 Gaps in Hotel-Relevant Products**

**Critical gaps for hospitality projects:**

1. **Furniture**: BVB database lacks comprehensive coverage of hotel furniture (beds, desks, lounge seating, dining chairs). Hotels rely on:[gotessons+1](https://gotessons.com/dk/baeredygtighed/Et-bedre-produktvalg)​  
2. **Möbelfakta** (Swedish furniture quality standard with environmental criteria)[efg](https://www.efg.se/en/stories/which-eco-labels-are-relevant/)​  
3. **Nordic Swan Ecolabel** for furniture[efg+1](https://www.efg.se/en/stories/which-eco-labels-are-relevant/)​  
4. **OEKO-TEX** for textile components[1concier](https://www.1concier.com/production-and-sustainability-certifications-in-the-hotel-industry/)​  
5. **FSC/PEFC** for wood content[efg](https://www.efg.se/en/stories/which-eco-labels-are-relevant/)​  
6. **Textiles**: BVB assesses technical textiles (acoustic panels, wall coverings) but not hospitality soft goods (bedding, towels, curtains, upholstery). Hotels use:[lintex+2](https://www.lintex.com/row/en/circular-products/)​  
7. **OEKO-TEX Standard 100** (chemical safety)[1concier](https://www.1concier.com/production-and-sustainability-certifications-in-the-hotel-industry/)​  
8. **GOTS** (organic textiles)[fibre2fashion](https://www.fibre2fashion.com/industry-article/10800/strategies-for-use-of-sustainable-textiles-in-hotels)​  
9. **EU Ecolabel** or Nordic Swan for textiles[green-care-professional+1](https://www.green-care-professional.com/about-green-care-professional/certifications/)​  
10. **Lighting**: BVB coverage is fragmented—some LED modules rated, but complete architectural lighting systems rarely assessed. Specifiers rely on:[svanurinn+1](https://svanurinn.is/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/089e-3-17-bd.pdf)​  
11. Energy efficiency labels (EU Ecolabel)[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_building_certification_systems)​  
12. LCA data from manufacturers[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/globalassets/project/lore-lca/deliverables/lore-lca-wp2-d2.1-ifz-report.pdf)​  
13. Compliance with building codes (BBR requirements)[odr.chalmers](https://odr.chalmers.se/bitstreams/41d80c70-dc6d-447e-8740-4cf5abf5a06a/download)​  
14. **Kitchen and bathroom**: Minimal BVB presence. Compliance driven by:  
15. CE marking (mandatory)[oneclicklca](https://oneclicklca.com/en/resources/articles/digital-product-passport-whats-a-dpp)​  
16. Water efficiency labels (Nordic Swan for water fixtures)[nordic-swan-ecolabel+1](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/criteria/hotels-and-other-accommodation-055/)​  
17. Manufacturer-specific EPDs[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/globalassets/project/lore-lca/deliverables/lore-lca-wp2-d2.1-ifz-report.pdf)​

## **3.3 Handling Non-Rated Products**

**What happens when preferred product lacks BVB rating?**  
**Option 1: Commission BVB assessment**

1. Manufacturer (not specifier) must apply[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/get-started-with-byggvarubedomningen/)​  
2. Cost: Subscription \+ potential NDA fee (6,000 SEK)[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/)​  
3. Timeline: 10-20 working days[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/)​  
4. **Feasibility**: Low for hotel projects with tight schedules or international products not sold via Swedish manufacturers

**Option 2: Equivalent documentation**  
Sweden's Miljöbyggnad certification (most relevant for hotels pursuing environmental credentials) accepts **alternative documentation** to BVB:[byggvarubedomningen+2](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/confidential-information-in-our-assessments/)​  
Accepted equivalents for material documentation:

1. **Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)** per ISO 14025 / EN 15804[byggmaterialindustrierna+1](https://byggmaterialindustrierna.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Guidelines-ENG.pdf)​  
2. **Nordic Swan Ecolabel**[nordic-swan-ecolabel+2](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/official-nordic-ecolabel/)​  
3. **EU Ecolabel**[europa+2](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/documents/technical_report_furniture.pdf)​  
4. **Cradle to Cradle Certified** (Bronze or higher)[professionals.tarkett+2](https://professionals.tarkett.com/en_EU/node/cradle-to-cradle-certifications-9727)​  
5. **BASTA** registration (for hazardous substance criteria)[ki+1](https://ki.se/media/256819/download)​  
6. **SundaHus** rating (A or B)[ecolabelindex+2](https://www.ecolabelindex.com/ecolabels/?st=country%2Cse)​

**Option 3: "Or equal" specification language**  
For projects without certification requirements, specifiers can write performance-based specs accepting BVB **or equivalent** (see Section 4.3 below).  
**Cost/Benefit of Custom Rating:**  
Rarely pursued for individual hotel projects because:

1. Manufacturer must drive application (hotel owner/specifier cannot)[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/get-started-with-byggvarubedomningen/)​  
2. ROI only makes sense if product will be sold across multiple Swedish projects[byggvarubedomningen](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/get-started-with-byggvarubedomningen/)​  
3. Alternative certifications (Nordic Swan, OEKO-TEX) already provide market access[green-care-professional+2](https://www.green-care-professional.com/about-green-care-professional/certifications/)​

**Notes:**

1. **EPDs alone are insufficient**: They document impacts but do not set performance thresholds. Combine EPDs with compliance certifications (REACH, RoHS, VOC limits).[byggmaterialindustrierna+1](https://byggmaterialindustrierna.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Guidelines-ENG.pdf)​  
2. **Nordic Swan ≈ BVB Recommended**: Nordic Swan's chemical and lifecycle criteria are broadly equivalent to or stricter than BVB "Recommended".[nordic-swan-ecolabel+2](https://www.nordic-swan-ecolabel.org/official-nordic-ecolabel/)​  
3. **OEKO-TEX**: Addresses chemical safety but not lifecycle aspects—acceptable for "Accepted" equivalent, not "Recommended".[1concier](https://www.1concier.com/production-and-sustainability-certifications-in-the-hotel-industry/)​

## **4.3 Reclaimed Product Documentation Framework**

**Challenge**: BVB cannot assess reclaimed products; hotels pursuing circularity need alternative validation.[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/rebus/assessment-of-construction-products-for-reuse/)​  
**Proposed Documentation Framework for Used/Reclaimed Products:**

## **4.3.1 Environmental Benefit Quantification**

**Embodied Carbon Avoidance Calculation:**  
Use recognized LCA methodology (EN 15978, RICS Whole Life Carbon Assessment Standard, One Click LCA) to demonstrate:  
Carbon Savings=Baseline New ProductA1−A5−(RefurbishmentC+A+TransportA4)\\text{Carbon Savings} \= \\text{Baseline New Product}\_{A1-A5} \- (\\text{Refurbishment}\_{C+A} \+ \\text{Transport}\_{A4})Carbon Savings=Baseline New ProductA1−A5−(RefurbishmentC+A+TransportA4)**Minimum acceptable threshold: 60% carbon savings vs. new manufacture**.[lib.purdue+1](https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1691&context=cib-conferences)​  
**Example calculation** (office chair):

1. New chair embodied carbon: 150 kg CO₂e (A1-A5 stages)[rmi+1](https://rmi.org/embodied-carbon-101/)​  
2. Reclaimed chair:  
3. Refurbishment (cleaning, reupholstery, repairs): 20 kg CO₂e  
4. Transport: 5 kg CO₂e  
5. Total: 25 kg CO₂e  
6. Savings: (150 \- 25\) / 150 \= **83% reduction** ✓

**Data sources:**

1. EPD databases: One Click LCA, Ökobaudat, ICE Database[circularecology+1](https://circularecology.com/embodied-carbon-footprint-database.html)​  
2. Transport emissions: EcoTransIt calculator or national factors[ecotransit](https://www.ecotransit.org/wp-content/uploads/20240308_Methodology_Report_Update_2024.pdf)​

## **4.3.2 Quality and Safety Verification**

**Fire Safety Re-Testing:**  
Critical for upholstery and textiles—cannot rely on original product certifications if:

1. Fire retardant treatments degrade over time  
2. Reupholstery introduces new materials  
3. Original fire test reports unavailable

**Mandatory:** Third-party re-testing per EN 13501-1 (Euroclass) and relevant small-flame tests (EN 1021-1/2, EN ISO 11925-2).[finsa+3](https://www.finsa.com/documents/d/guest/catalogue-fire-retardant-2023-en-en-low-res-pdf)​  
**Hazardous Substance Screening:**  
Older products may contain substances now banned under REACH:

1. **Minimum screening**: Portable XRF analysis for heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, chromium VI)  
2. **If suspect materials identified**: Lab analysis per EN 1122 (specific substance testing)  
3. **For textiles**: Azo dye testing (EN 14362), phthalate analysis, formaldehyde testing

**Hygiene Certification:**  
Especially for textiles in guest contact (mattresses, upholstery):

1. Professional cleaning per ISO 14644 or national hospitality standards

## **4.4 Client Communication Guide**

**Purpose**: Help Fyra explain BVB and circularity strategies to hotel clients unfamiliar with Swedish sustainability frameworks.

## **One-Page Client Briefing Template**

**TO:** \[Hotel Client/Owner\]  
**FROM:** Fyra \[Project Manager Name\]  
**RE:** Environmental Product Specification Strategy – Byggvarubedömningen (BVB) and Circular Economy  
**What is Byggvarubedömningen (BVB)?**  
BVB is Sweden's leading construction product assessment system, evaluating building materials based on:

1. **Chemical content**: Restricting hazardous substances (e.g., toxic flame retardants, heavy metals, carcinogens) to protect occupant health  
2. **Lifecycle impact**: Assessing energy use, emissions, recyclability, and end-of-life disposal

Over **30,000 products** are rated on a traffic light scale:

1. **Green (Recommended)**: Lowest health/environmental risk  
2. **Yellow (Accepted)**: Meets baseline standards  
3. **Red (To be avoided)**: Contains harmful substances or high environmental impact

**Why Specify BVB-Rated Products?**

1. **Health and Safety**: Reduces indoor air pollutants (VOCs, formaldehyde) that affect guest comfort and staff wellbeing. Swedish studies show 74% reduction in hazardous material use since BVB adoption.  
2. **Regulatory Alignment**: Sweden's Miljöbyggnad building certification accepts BVB documentation, streamlining compliance if pursuing environmental credentials.  
3. **Risk Mitigation**: BVB-rated products undergo third-party assessment, reducing risk of future liabilities (e.g., product recalls, health claims).  
4. **Market Expectations**: Major Swedish property owners (including public sector) increasingly require BVB or equivalent—future-proofing the asset for sale or refinancing.

**Cost Implications:**

1. **BVB-rated products**: Typically **cost-neutral** to 5-10% premium for "Recommended" vs. "Accepted" ratings (varies by category).  
2. **Alternative certifications** (Nordic Swan, OEKO-TEX, Cradle to Cradle): Comparable pricing; we accept equivalents to avoid sole-source constraints.  
3. **Reclaimed products**: Often **15-40% cost savings** vs. new, with documented environmental benefits (60%+ carbon reduction).

**Circular Economy Integration:**  
Beyond BVB, we're specifying products that support circularity:

1. **Recycled content**: Minimum 30-50% post-consumer material (e.g., carpet tiles from recycled fishing nets)  
2. **Take-back programs**: Manufacturers collect end-of-life products for recycling (e.g., Interface carpet, lighting fixtures under WEEE compliance)  
3. **Reclaimed products**: Incorporating refurbished furniture and vintage fixtures where structurally sound and fire-safe—dramatically reducing embodied carbon

**Your Role:**

1. **Approve strategy**: Confirm acceptance of BVB/"or equivalent" specification approach (flexibility to use Nordic Swan, EU Ecolabel, etc.)  
2. **Set priorities**: Indicate if pursuing environmental certification (Miljöbyggnad, Nordic Swan) or voluntary best-practice  
3. **Budget allocation**: Any specific budget constraints for premium materials vs. baseline compliance?

**Next Steps:**

1. Fyra will develop product-specific specs with BVB/equivalent requirements (draft for review by \[date\]).  
2. We'll identify opportunities for reclaimed products (e.g., vintage furniture for lobby/restaurant) and quantify carbon savings.  
3. Monthly progress reports will track percentage of BVB/"equivalent" products specified.

**Questions?** Contact \[Fyra Project Manager\] at \[email/phone\].

## **5\. Advocacy and Future Development**

## **5.1 Gaps in BVB System for Circular Economy**

**What's Missing:**

1. **Reclaimed Product Pathway**: No assessment framework for used/refurbished products—forces reliance on alternative documentation.[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/rebus/assessment-of-construction-products-for-reuse/)​  
2. **Reparability/Modularity**: Unlike EU proposals for reparability scoring, BVB does not evaluate design for disassembly, spare part availability, or modular construction.[research.tudelft+2](https://research.tudelft.nl/files/125581349/sustainability_14_08634.pdf)​  
3. **Circularity Metrics**: No scoring for:  
4. Product-as-a-service business models (leasing, performance contracting)  
5. Material Health Certificates (Declare-style ingredient transparency)[c2ccertified+2](https://c2ccertified.org/material-health-certificate)​  
6. Digital product passports (traceability via QR codes, blockchain)[sigmatechnology+2](https://sigmatechnology.com/articles/navigating-the-eus-digital-product-passport-for-construction/)​  
7. **Weighting**: All lifecycle criteria equally weighted—no bonus for exceeding thresholds (e.g., 90% vs. 50% recycled content both \= "Recommended").[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/)​  
8. **Pre-Consumer Recycled Content**: Excludes production scrap from recycled content calculation, though such material avoids landfilling.[byggvarubedomningen+1](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/3mmluv5k/criteria-60.pdf)​

**How Should BVB Evolve?**  
**Recommended enhancements:**

1. **Tiered recycled content**: Bronze (25%), Silver (50%), Gold (75%), Platinum (90%+)  
2. **Reparability module**: Adopt criteria from EU reparability scoring (disassembly time, spare parts, repair instructions)[benelux+1](https://www.benelux.int/files/7915/2896/0920/FINAL_Report_Benelux.pdf)​  
3. **Reclaimed product protocol**: Collaborate with SINTEF and other researchers to pilot testing frameworks for used materials[sintef](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/rebus/assessment-of-construction-products-for-reuse/)​  
4. **Digital passport integration**: Align with EU's Digital Product Passport (DPP) requirements under Construction Products Regulation revision[cobuilder+2](https://cobuilder.com/en/preparing-for-the-digital-product-passport-regulation/)​

1. **Reclaimed product assessment**: Propose pilot program for used furniture, lighting, and architectural salvage  
2. **Reparability criteria**: Introduce modular design and spare part availability as "bonus" criteria (not mandatory, but contribute to "Recommended" rating)  
3. **Hospitality-specific coverage**: Identify product gaps (furniture, decorative textiles, lighting) and encourage manufacturers to seek BVB ratings

## **5.3 Alternative and Complementary Systems**

**If BVB limitations persist, which systems better support circularity?**  
SystemStrengths for CircularityWeaknessesUse Case  
**Cradle to Cradle Certified**  
\- Explicit Material Reutilization category (Bronze-Platinum levels)  
\- Material Health Certificate option  
\- Requires take-back or recyclability planning[getgreenbadger+2](https://getgreenbadger.com/cradle-to-cradle/)​  
\- Expensive certification (€5,000-€20,000+ per product)  
\- Limited adoption in Sweden vs. NL/DE/US  
Premium products; specify where client prioritizes circularity leadership  
**Nordic Swan Ecolabel**  
\- Holistic lifecycle assessment  
\- Strong chemical restrictions (stricter than BVB for some substances)  
\- Covers more product categories (textiles, furniture)[green-care-professional+2](https://www.green-care-professional.com/about-green-care-professional/certifications/)​  
\- Does not explicitly score circularity metrics (recycled content is criterion but not weighted)  
\- Focus on new products (no reclaimed pathway)  
Hotels pursuing Nordic Swan certification; broad product coverage  
**Declare (ILFI)**  
\- Full ingredient transparency (100 ppm threshold)  
\- Red List screening for toxic substances

**Recommendation for Fyra:**  
**Multi-tiered specification strategy:**

1. **Tier 1 (Mandatory)**: BVB "Accepted" or equivalent (Nordic Swan, EU Ecolabel, OEKO-TEX)—establishes safety baseline  
2. **Tier 2 (Preferred)**: BVB "Recommended" or superior equivalent (Cradle to Cradle Silver+, Nordic Swan)—targeted for 70%+ of specifications  
3. **Tier 3 (Innovation)**: Reclaimed products with documented performance \+ carbon savings—targeted for 10-20% of furniture, lighting, architectural elements

**When to Require BVB vs. Alternatives:**

1. **Require BVB**: Flooring, paints, insulation, panels—categories with robust BVB coverage and wide manufacturer participation  
2. **Accept Alternatives**: Furniture, decorative textiles, lighting—specify "BVB Recommended or equivalent" with equivalency matrix (Section 4.2)  
3. **Performance-Based Specs**: Reclaimed products, innovative materials—define chemical, safety, and environmental performance targets without mandating specific certification

## **Conclusion and Recommendations for Fyra**

BVB provides a **solid foundation** for specifying low-toxicity, recyclable construction products but requires **supplementation** to achieve comprehensive circularity in hotel projects. Fyra's specification strategy should:

1. **Use BVB as baseline** for product categories with strong coverage (flooring, paints, panels)—target "Recommended" rating where feasible.[byggvarubedomningen+2](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/ofvf2ovc/criteria-70.pdf)​  
2. **Develop equivalency pathways** for furniture, textiles, and lighting using Nordic Swan, OEKO-TEX, Möbelfakta, and EPD-based performance specs.[green-care-professional+2](https://www.green-care-professional.com/about-green-care-professional/certifications/)​  
3. **Pioneer reclaimed product integration** through robust documentation: embodied carbon calculations, third-party safety testing, and hazardous substance screening.[sciencedirect+2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344924005238)​  
4. **Engage in advocacy** by joining BVB/SGBC working groups to propose reclaimed product assessment protocols and reparability criteria.[ivl+2](https://www.ivl.se/english/ivl/about-ivl.html)​  
5. **Communicate value** to clients through clear, quantified benefits: indoor air quality improvements, carbon savings (60%+ for reclaimed products), and future-proofed regulatory compliance.[sciencedirect+2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344924005238)​

By combining BVB's chemical safety rigor with Fyra's circularity expertise, hotel projects can achieve leading-edge environmental performance while navigating the practical limitations of current certification systems.
