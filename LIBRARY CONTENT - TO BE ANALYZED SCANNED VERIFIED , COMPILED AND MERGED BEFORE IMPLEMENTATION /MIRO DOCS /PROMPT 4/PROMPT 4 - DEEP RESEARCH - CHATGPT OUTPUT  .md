# **Byggvarubedömningen (BVB) – Integration of Circular Economy Criteria**

## **Overview of the BVB System**

What is BVB? *Byggvarubedömningen* (BVB) is a Swedish non-profit building materials assessment system that evaluates construction products for sustainability and health impacts

[eco-institut.de](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/#:~:text=Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20is%20a%20Swedish%20organisation,for%20present%20and%20future%20generations)

. Founded in 2006 through an initiative of major Swedish property owners, BVB’s mission is to promote toxin-free, environmentally sustainable construction

[eco-institut.de](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/#:~:text=Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20was%20founded%20in%202006,for%20assessing%20the%20environmental%20properties)

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/about-us/#:~:text=About%20us%20,About%20us)

. The system provides a database of assessed products and a digital Logbook tool to trace all materials used in a building, supporting green building certifications like Miljöbyggnad, BREEAM, and the Nordic Swan Ecolabel

[fmmattsson.com](https://www.fmmattsson.com/environmental-assessments/byggvarubedomningen#:~:text=Construction,like%20Milj%C3%B6byggnad%2C%20BREEAM%2C%20and%20Svanen)

. BVB is administered by a membership association of large real estate companies (with technical support from institutes like IVL Svenska Miljöinstitutet), and it continuously updates its criteria to align with new research and regulations

[eco-institut.de](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/#:~:text=Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20is%20also%20committed%20to,scientific%20findings%20and%20legal%20requirements)

. Importantly, participation in BVB is voluntary – it is not mandated by law – but it has become an industry standard in Sweden due to market demand for sustainable products

[wwwvasakronanse.cdn.triggerfish.cloud](https://wwwvasakronanse.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2024/04/vasakronan-annual-and-sustainability-report-2023-2.pdf#:~:text=and%20using%20the%20Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20system,up%20in%20conjunc%02tion%20with%20the)

. Many developers and public clients now require BVB assessments in their projects, effectively making it a de facto requirement for manufacturers targeting the Swedish construction market

[wwwvasakronanse.cdn.triggerfish.cloud](https://wwwvasakronanse.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2024/04/vasakronan-annual-and-sustainability-report-2023-2.pdf#:~:text=and%20using%20the%20Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20system,up%20in%20conjunc%02tion%20with%20the)

. For example, major property firms use BVB in *all* projects and even write it into tenant lease requirements

[wwwvasakronanse.cdn.triggerfish.cloud](https://wwwvasakronanse.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2024/04/vasakronan-annual-and-sustainability-report-2023-2.pdf#:~:text=and%20using%20the%20Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20system,up%20in%20conjunc%02tion%20with%20the)

, illustrating the high adoption rate. BVB’s database contains thousands of products and has been used in tens of thousands of building project logbooks

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/about-us/industry-report-2025/#:~:text=The%20report%20is%20based%20on,built%20between%202017%20and%202023)

, showing broad uptake across the Swedish building industry (including residential, offices, schools, and increasingly hospitality projects). Rating System (A/B/C/F): BVB assesses each product against a set of criteria covering chemical content and lifecycle attributes. Products receive one of three possible ratings presented in a “traffic-light” format: “Recommended” (green), “Accepted” (yellow), or “To be avoided” (red)

[eco-institut.de](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/#:~:text=Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20provides%20a%20platform%20for,informed%20decisions%20about%20sustainable%20building)

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=An%20environmental%20assessment%20by%20Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen,red)

. In some documentation these are also referred to by letters (historically A \= Recommended, B \= Accepted, C \= To be avoided); a fourth category sometimes noted as “F” essentially means a failing or not approved status (e.g. containing prohibited substances), but in practice BVB uses the three-tier scale

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=FAQ%20,Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%27s)

. A “Recommended” (green/A) rating signifies the product meets all of BVB’s strict criteria – it contains no hazardous chemicals above minimal thresholds and excels in lifecycle and supply chain aspects

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=FAQ%20,Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%27s)

. “Accepted” (yellow/B) indicates the product is acceptable – it meets the basic requirements (complies with laws and BVB’s acceptable limits) but may not achieve all the best-practice criteria. “To be avoided” (red/C) is given to products that contain concerning substances or have poor environmental performance, and thus should be avoided in projects

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=FAQ%20,Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%27s)

. (Manufacturers sometimes use the term “Not approved” or “F” for products that fall outside BVB’s acceptable range entirely.) BVB’s rating is holistic, considering both material health and environmental lifecycle factors. For simplicity, one can think of Green/Recommended as “best in class,” Yellow/Accepted as “okay to use but not optimal,” and Red/Avoided as “unsuitable for conscientious projects.” These ratings allow even non-experts to quickly judge a product’s sustainability

[eco-institut.de](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/#:~:text=Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20provides%20a%20platform%20for,informed%20decisions%20about%20sustainable%20building)

. Criteria and Weighting: The assessment criteria are developed by expert groups from BVB’s member organizations

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/#:~:text=The%20assessments%20are%20based%20on,date)

. There are two main sets of criteria: one for Chemical Content & Life Cycle aspects, and a separate set for Sustainable Supply Chains (social responsibility)

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/#:~:text=The%20assessments%20are%20based%20on,date)

. Within the chemical/lifecycle domain, BVB evaluates products on \~30 factors across the product’s life cycle

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/#:~:text=Chemical%20content%20and%20life,cycle%20aspect)

. This includes seven key areas often highlighted by BVB: (1) Constituents and raw materials, (2) Production (manufacturing impacts), (3) Construction phase impacts, (4) Usage phase (emissions during use), (5) End-of-life/demolition, (6) Supply chain responsibility, and (7) Indoor environment impact

[saicmknowledge.org](https://saicmknowledge.org/page/chemical-substitutes-and-alternatives#:~:text=Chemical%20substitutes%20and%20alternatives%20,the%20management%20phase%3B%20Demolition%3B)

. Each criterion is scored at one of three levels (Recommended, Accepted, To be avoided), and an algorithm or set of rules determines the overall product rating

[modulex.com](https://modulex.com/news/articles/swedish-bvb-approves-five-modulex-products/#:~:text=All%20Modulex%20products%20have%20been,in%20the%20Swedish%20BVB)

. Typically, to achieve an overall “Recommended” rating, the product must meet *all* high-priority criteria at the Recommended level (for example, contain no substances from the restricted list and satisfy thresholds for recyclability, etc.), whereas “Accepted” allows some criteria to be at an intermediate level

[modulex.com](https://modulex.com/news/articles/swedish-bvb-approves-five-modulex-products/#:~:text=All%20Modulex%20products%20have%20been,in%20the%20Swedish%20BVB)

. Any critical failure (like containing a banned substance) would immediately yield “To be avoided.” In essence, BVB uses a precautionary approach – products with incomplete data or potentially harmful contents tend to get lower ratings. The weighting is somewhat strict on chemical safety (if a product contains a *Candidate List* SVHC chemical above 0.1%, it will likely be Avoided)

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=Does%20the%20product%20or%20any,for%20control%20the%20Candidate%20List)

. Environmental lifecycle factors (like recycled content, energy use, end-of-life recyclability) also influence the rating, but the product *must* clear the chemical safety hurdles first. Assessment Process: *How does a product get a BVB rating?* Manufacturers or suppliers initiate the assessment by submitting detailed documentation to BVB. They must fill out BVB’s forms (or an online questionnaire) providing information on the product’s chemical composition (down to 0.01% for a Recommended-level transparency)

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=Are%20all%20substances%20reported%20in,which%20is%20found%20at%20the)

, safety data sheets, material origin, manufacturing impacts, and end-of-life handling

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=Does%20the%20product%20or%20any,for%20control%20the%20Candidate%20List)

. BVB’s criteria group reviews the submission against their standards. If the documentation is complete and the product meets the criteria, BVB assigns the rating and lists the product in its database. The assessment covers the entire product (for composite products, each sub-component’s content must be declared

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=2%202,for%20control%20the%20Candidate)

). Notably, manufacturers are responsible for providing accurate data – BVB doesn’t independently test products, but it may require third-party verifications (e.g. an ISO 14025 EPD or lab emission test results) to award a Recommended level on certain criteria

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=2,2)

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=Information%20is%20to%20be%20reported,To%20be%20avoided)

. Assessments typically take a few weeks to a couple of months, depending on complexity and the completeness of supplied data. Once approved, a product’s rating is valid as long as its information remains current; re-assessments may be needed if the formula changes or when BVB updates criteria. Who can rate and what does it cost? Manufacturers/suppliers themselves apply for BVB assessment of their products – these are not ratings that architects or third parties can assign arbitrarily. BVB charges fees to cover the assessment service. As of 2024, suppliers pay an annual subscription (around 4,800 SEK) to have a full BVB account

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=In%20order%20for%20you%20as,1%2C000%20SEK)

, plus a fee per product assessment. The fee for a new product assessment is on the order of a few thousand SEK (historically around 6,000 SEK for a full review)

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=In%20order%20for%20you%20as,1%2C000%20SEK)

. There may be additional costs if confidentiality is requested (to hide proprietary formulas while still getting assessed)

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=In%20order%20for%20you%20as,1%2C000%20SEK)

. In practice, many large manufacturers see this as a worthwhile investment because a BVB rating increases their product’s acceptability in Swedish projects. Assessments can be done by BVB’s in-house team, and BVB also recognizes certain external test reports (for example, a product that already has an eco-INSTITUT emissions certification can use that to meet BVB’s emission criteria)

[eco-institut.de](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/#:~:text=Image)

. The system is funded by membership fees from both the supply side (manufacturers) and the demand side (property owner members), ensuring its independence and non-profit nature. In summary, any manufacturer can seek a BVB rating for their product by supplying the required information and paying the fee, after which the product will be listed as either Recommended, Accepted or To Be Avoided in the BVB database.

## **Circular Economy Criteria in BVB**

One of the focal points of this research is how BVB incorporates circular economy principles into its criteria. BVB was initially very focused on chemical health and eliminating hazardous substances (a “toxin-free” environment). In recent years, it has expanded its criteria to address resource efficiency and circularity across a product’s life cycle. Below we examine specific circular economy aspects in BVB: Recycled Content in Products: BVB actively gathers data on and rewards the use of recycled materials in products. In the BVB assessment form, suppliers must declare whether the product contains recycled material and, if so, what percentage of the product’s weight is recycled

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=3,Recycled%20material%20Material%20Percentage)

. They are required to break this down into pre-consumer vs. post-consumer recycled content

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=product%E2%80%99s%20weight%20Percentage%20%28,the%20recycled%20material%20that%20has)

. (Pre-consumer refers to industrial scrap or production waste reused; post-consumer refers to material recovered after a product’s end-use.) BVB’s criteria give more credit to true post-consumer recycled content. In fact, BVB defines “recycled material” in line with the EU Waste Framework Directive – it must be material that has reached end-of-use as a consumer product and then been reclaimed

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=Recycled%20material%20,does%20not%20apply%20to%20recycled)

. Internal production scrap doesn’t fully count toward the recycled content criterion. To score Recommended on the “recycled material” factor, a product must contain at least 50% recycled content by weight

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=1,Accepted)

. If the recycled portion is lower, the product can still be Accepted for that criterion (e.g. anything from a few percent up to 49% recycled might fall in the Accepted range)

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=1,Accepted)

. If no recycled content data is provided, BVB marks it as “Information lacking” (which can negatively affect the overall rating if other criteria aren’t excellent)

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=Recycled%20materials%20%3C50,To%20be%20avoided)

. Notably, BVB’s threshold of ≥50% for recycled content is quite ambitious – it pushes manufacturers to incorporate substantial recycled material to get a top score. This is especially relevant for products like metals (e.g., steel rebar often contains \~90% scrap metal, which would easily meet Recommended) and plastics. For instance, a building insulation product with 20% recycled plastic would meet the basic requirement (Accepted) but would need to reach 50% to be fully Recommended on that aspect

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=1,Accepted)

. BVB does *not* explicitly differentiate pre- vs post-consumer in the rating, but by their definition only post-consumer truly counts toward the “recycled” percentage

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=Recycled%20material%20,does%20not%20apply%20to%20recycled)

. In practice, having a high recycled content can improve a product’s life-cycle score and make it more likely to achieve an overall Recommended rating, provided other criteria (like chemical safety) are also satisfied. BVB also asks for documentation of recycled content claims – the supplier might need to provide an ISO 14021 self-declaration or third-party validation for the recycled percentage. Material Reuse and Design for Disassembly: BVB criteria consider whether a product (or its components) can be reused at end-of-life. In the assessment, suppliers are asked: “Is it possible to re-use all or parts of the product when it becomes waste?”

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=%E2%98%90%20Yes%20X%20No%20Is,All%20metals%20can%20be%20recycled)

. A *Yes* answer (with explanation) indicates the product has some reuse potential, such as being designed for disassembly and reassembly elsewhere. To achieve a top rating, BVB sets a high bar: for Recommended, at least 70% of the product (by weight) should be reusable

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=Reuse%20is%20possible%20for%20%E2%89%A570,of%20the%20product.1)

. This means the product is likely a durable component that can be recovered intact – e.g. demountable partitions, modular furniture, or refillable systems. If reuse is possible but less than 70%, or only for some parts, that might fall under Accepted. If the product is essentially non-reusable (and must be discarded after use), that aspect would be To be avoided or at least not contribute positively

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=Reuse%20is%20possible%20for%20%E2%89%A570,of%20the%20product.1)

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20product%20cannot%20be,Information)

. Designing for disassembly is indirectly rewarded because it enables both reuse and recycling. While BVB’s questionnaire doesn’t explicitly ask “Are components separable for recycling?”, it asks if material recycling is possible for parts of the product

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=If%20yes%2C%20describe%3A%20Is%20material,supplier%20have%20any%20restrictions%20and)

. A product designed modularly, with standardized connections and available spare parts, is more likely to be reusable or at least easier to recycle, thereby scoring better on those criteria. BVB does inquire if there are maintenance or operating instructions for the product

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=Are%20there%20any%20special%20requirements,2010%2F30%2FEU)

 – having care instructions implies the product is meant to be maintained and potentially have a long life, which aligns with circular goals (though this is a minor point in the assessment). One area BVB hasn’t heavily formalized is repairability: there isn’t a specific criterion like “Product can be repaired or has X-year spare parts availability.” However, indirectly, a product that is not repairable might still meet BVB criteria as long as its materials are recyclable and it has no toxins. This is a nuance: BVB’s focus is more on end-of-life *outcomes* (reuse, recycle) rather than guaranteeing the product’s lifespan or repair modularity. In future updates, BVB might incorporate more explicit repairability metrics (similar to the EU’s material efficiency standards), but as of now, these concepts are acknowledged in principle but not deeply detailed in scoring. End-of-Life Management (Recyclability & Take-Back): BVB strongly emphasizes what happens to a product at the end of its life. The assessment form includes a dedicated “Waste management” section

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=7,products%20when%20it%20becomes%20waste)

. Suppliers must indicate if the product will require special handling at demolition (e.g. contains hazardous materials needing special disposal)

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=7,electronic%20products%20when%20it%20becomes)

, and whether the product can be recycled or energy-recovered. To achieve a Recommended rating on end-of-life, a product should be materially recyclable to a high degree. Specifically, BVB’s criterion is that ≥70% of the product’s material can be recycled in practice

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=Material%20recycling%20is%20possible%20for,of%20the)

. For example, if a raised floor panel is made of steel and clean plastic, and over 70% of it can be separated and recycled as material, it meets the recommended level

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=Material%20recycling%20is%20possible%20for,of%20the)

. If recycling is possible only as downcycling (e.g. using the material as fill or incineration), that might downgrade it to Accepted

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20below%20applies%3A,of%20the)

. BVB even addresses scenarios: if direct material recycling at demolition isn’t feasible, having an established system to collect and recycle construction *installation offcuts* can count toward partial fulfillment

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Energy%20recycling%20is%20possible,To%20be%20avoided)

 (though ultimately, if *neither* recycling nor energy recovery can handle 70% of the product, it is To be avoided on that criterion

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20product%20cannot%20be,Information)

). For instance, a product that is a complex composite of many bonded materials might end up in the “to be avoided” category due to poor recyclability. Another aspect is whether the manufacturer offers take-back programs for their products. While BVB encourages extended producer responsibility, the standard form only explicitly asks about take-back of packaging materials

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=State%20whether%20any%20system%20for,materials%3A%20cardboard%2C%20foil%2C%20wooden%20pallet)

. Suppliers should state if they participate in packaging recycling schemes and how much of the packaging is recycled

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=State%20whether%20any%20system%20for,materials%3A%20cardboard%2C%20foil%2C%20wooden%20pallet)

. There isn’t a direct question like “Do you have a product take-back program at end-of-life?” except where legislation mandates one (for example, electronics under the WEEE Directive – BVB asks if the product falls under WEEE and thus has a producer responsibility scheme

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=Is%20the%20product%20covered%20by,X%20No%20If%20yes%2C%20describe)

). However, manufacturers that voluntarily implement take-back or refurbishment programs can mention this in their documentation, and it would strengthen the product’s case for recyclability/reuse in the eyes of BVB reviewers. In practice, a product with a take-back program might achieve better outcomes (because the company ensures it gets recycled or refurbished, thus achieving that ≥70% recycling in reality). BVB also checks if a discarded product would classify as hazardous waste

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=Does%20the%20supplier%20have%20any,waste%3F%20%E2%98%90%20Yes%20X%20No)

 – if yes, that’s a clear negative factor. For example, if a material is treated with substances that make its waste hazardous (like certain preservative-treated wood or electronics with heavy metals), it would likely not get Recommended regardless of other merits. Furthermore, BVB distinguishes material recycling vs. energy recovery. It asks if energy recovery (incineration with energy capture) is possible for ≥70% of the product

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Energy%20recycling%20is%20possible,To%20be%20avoided)

. Energy recovery is considered a lower priority than material recycling, but if a product can at least be safely burned for energy (and not landfilled), that is noted. The worst case (“To be avoided”) is a product that cannot be recycled materially *or* safely energy-recovered for the majority of its mass

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20product%20cannot%20be,Information)

. In summary, a product’s design for end-of-life – being recyclable, avoiding hazardous components that impede recycling, and possibly being supported by take-back logistics – is a key component of BVB’s circular economy criteria. Many manufacturers seeking BVB approval have adapted by, for instance, using single-material components where possible or ensuring metal parts are easily separable, so that they can answer “Yes” to the recycling question and reach that 70% threshold. Hazardous Substances and Circularity: From a circular perspective, removing hazardous chemicals is critical because it keeps materials “clean” for reuse. BVB has stringent chemical requirements (aligned with REACH, CLP, etc.), which indirectly serve circular economy goals by preventing problematic substances from entering material loops. For example, halogenated flame retardants or heavy metals not only pose health risks but also make recycling difficult (e.g. PVC with lead stabilizers becomes hazardous waste). BVB will grade such products poorly – typically “Avoid” if they contain substances from restricted lists above threshold

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=content%20and%20lifecycle,red)

. This creates a *negative score* for things that hinder future recycling. In effect, BVB’s highest-rated products tend to be those designed without hazardous additives, meaning they can be safely recycled or composted. So circularity and toxicity are intertwined in the BVB methodology. Traceability and Transparency: Another circular economy enabler is having transparent information about materials (often termed *“material passports”* in the building sector). BVB contributes here by requiring a detailed Bill of Materials for each product. The supplier must list all constituents down to 0.01% (for Recommended level)

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=Are%20all%20substances%20reported%20in,which%20is%20found%20at%20the)

 and declare any substances of very high concern (SVHC) present

. This essentially creates a product passport entry in the BVB database that can be referenced throughout the building’s life. In a future renovation or demolition, facility managers can consult the BVB logbook to see what materials are in their building

[fmmattsson.com](https://www.fmmattsson.com/environmental-assessments/byggvarubedomningen#:~:text=Construction,like%20Milj%C3%B6byggnad%2C%20BREEAM%2C%20and%20Svanen)

, aiding recycling and safe handling. BVB also recently introduced criteria for “Sustainable supply chains”, which touch on transparency beyond the product itself – for instance, BVB members sign a Code of Conduct and suppliers fill a self-assessment questionnaire about labor practices

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/downloads/#:~:text=Sustainable%20supply%20chains)

. While this is more about social sustainability, it complements circular economy by ensuring ethical sourcing of recycled materials and overall corporate responsibility. In terms of supply chain transparency, BVB expects suppliers to disclose origins of key raw materials. For wood products, there is a criterion for sustainable wood sourcing – a product is Recommended if all wood is FSC/PEFC certified, and the country of harvest and any endangered species info must be provided

[halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=If%20wood%20raw%20material%20is,certificate%20together%20with%20the%20application)

. This traceability helps in circular economy by guaranteeing renewable materials are responsibly sourced and can be traced if reused. For other materials (metals, minerals), BVB doesn’t yet have a full “material passport” system like some EU initiatives, but the detailed content declaration and logbook approach serve a similar function. Used or Reused Products in BVB: A critical question is whether *already-used (secondhand) products* can obtain a BVB rating. Currently, BVB is designed for new products and does not have a standard procedure to rate reclaimed items. The system relies on manufacturers to submit product data – in the case of a salvaged product, there may be no active manufacturer submission or the product might be many years old and not in the database. As of now, if one wants to use a reused component (say, a reclaimed door or a secondhand luminaire) in a project governed by BVB requirements, there is *no straightforward way to get that item “BVB-approved.”* BVB doesn’t explicitly forbid reused products, but by definition an assessment applies to a specific product type with known composition. An old product could be assessed *in theory* if its make/model is known and the original manufacturer provides the info (or it was assessed when new). However, practically, most reused products in circulation were never BVB-rated when they were new (especially if they predate BVB or are from abroad). Therefore, reused items typically end up being treated as exceptions in projects – outside the BVB system. BVB’s focus on transparency and chemical safety actually highlights one challenge with reusing older materials: if you don’t know the exact chemical content (e.g. older furniture might have flame retardants or foam blowing agents now banned), it wouldn’t meet BVB criteria. This is likely one reason BVB hasn’t integrated reused products – the uncertainty of composition and performance makes it hard to “rate” them. The current guidance from BVB or analogous systems is usually to prefer new products that have been assessed as safe, rather than reuse something of uncertain composition. That said, from a circular economy advocacy perspective, this is a gap. The inability to credit the environmental benefits of reuse is something many stakeholders (like architects and sustainability consultants) are now pointing out. There have been discussions in the industry about how to include reused materials in building assessments (for example, Sweden’s Klimatdeklaration law encourages reuse to reduce carbon, and some green building rating tools give innovation credits for reuse). BVB itself has not yet adapted to rate reused products, but it’s conceivable that future versions or parallel systems could allow a “generic” assessment for reused items (perhaps focusing on testing them for hazardous content and then granting an Accepted rating if they pass basic safety). As of now, if a project wants to use a second-hand item, the “equivalent” approach must be used: i.e., demonstrate through other documentation that the item meets the intent of BVB criteria (see Section D on equivalencies). In short, used products cannot currently receive a BVB A/B/C rating via the normal process, which is a limitation when pursuing circular economy strategies. Project teams can advocate for change by raising this issue with BVB’s leadership or contributing to development of guidelines for reused materials.

## **BVB in Practice – Focus on the Hospitality Sector**

How does BVB play out on actual projects, particularly in the hospitality sector (hotels)? Hotels combine typical building materials (structural elements, finishes) with extensive interiors and furnishings, so it’s an interesting case for BVB adoption. Below we explore the prevalence of BVB requirements in hotel projects, how product categories relevant to hotels are covered, and how teams handle items that aren’t BVB-rated. Adoption in Hotel Projects: In Sweden, many new construction and major renovation projects (including hotels) include BVB criteria as part of their environmental requirements. BVB is not yet universally mandatory for hotels, but it is increasingly common as a *“must-have” in high-end or sustainability-focused projects*. Publicly funded projects or those aiming for certifications often require choosing products from either BVB or similar assessment systems. Several major Scandinavian hotel operators have strong sustainability policies, though they might reference broader standards (like the Nordic Swan Ecolabel for hotels, which covers energy/chemicals) rather than BVB specifically. However, when hotel buildings are developed by large property companies, those companies do impose BVB. For example, if Company X (a property developer and BVB member) builds a new hotel building to lease to Scandic or Strawberry (Nordic Choice), Company X will require all building products and interior fit-out materials to meet BVB “Recommended or Accepted” ratings. There is evidence that leading real estate firms use BVB across the board – Vasakronan (one of Sweden’s biggest property owners) uses the BVB system in all projects and even requires it for tenant-led renovations

[wwwvasakronanse.cdn.triggerfish.cloud](https://wwwvasakronanse.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2024/04/vasakronan-annual-and-sustainability-report-2023-2.pdf#:~:text=and%20using%20the%20Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20system,up%20in%20conjunc%02tion%20with%20the)

. This suggests that when such firms build hotels or refurbish them, BVB is part of the specification. On the other hand, hotel operators themselves have varied approaches: Scandic Hotels has a sustainable procurement guideline (2024) that emphasizes circular economy and banned substances, but it doesn’t explicitly mention BVB by name. Strawberry/Nordic Choice Hotels similarly focus on things like recycled materials, but again may not require BVB unless the project is in a context where the investor or municipality requires it. In summary, BVB is more of a client/owner-driven requirement – so if the hotel project’s investor values it, it becomes effectively mandatory; if not, it might be a “nice-to-have.” Nonetheless, given Sweden’s general trends, many hospitality projects at least encourage the use of BVB-rated products to demonstrate sustainability. Investor and financing influence: It’s worth noting that green financing criteria often push for measured sustainability outcomes. Banks and investors might ask if materials are chosen to reduce toxic exposure and future liabilities. Using a database like BVB provides assurance on this front (e.g., Swedavia, the state airport operator, mandates BVB compliance for materials in its terminals

[swedavia.com](https://www.swedavia.com/globalassets/om-swedavia/roll-och-uppdrag/swedavias-annual-and-sustainability-report-2018.pdf#:~:text=,Swedavia%20obtains%20environmental)

, and one can draw parallels for hotel developers). Thus, hotel projects seeking green loans or certification likely incorporate BVB or an equivalent. In practice, BVB is seen as a risk-mitigation and quality tool – a way to avoid problematic materials that could cause issues (like bad indoor air or costly remediation later). Hotel owners concerned with long-term asset value might therefore require BVB-rated materials as a “must-have,” whereas for some smaller private hotel projects it might be a “nice-to-have” that depends on willing suppliers. Use in Hospitality – Examples: Some Scandinavian hotel chains have started to mention or utilize these material databases indirectly. For instance, Stordalen’s Strawberry group (formerly Nordic Choice) has pioneered using recycled and reclaimed materials in a few showcase hotel interiors. When doing so, they have had to balance that with criteria like BVB – often it means choosing reclaimed items that originally were of high quality (and hopefully low in toxins), or using new sustainable materials for other parts. Scandic, known for its sustainability efforts, often works with property owners who embed BVB into the project tender. Even if the hotel chain doesn’t demand it, the architects and contractors might include BVB as part of delivering a “healthy building” for the client. Thus, it’s increasingly common in hotel specifications in Sweden to see a clause like “All building products must be assessed in BVB (or equivalent)”. This can cover everything from paints, flooring, drywall to loose furniture if the specifier chooses. Product Categories and Coverage: BVB’s database has strong coverage of core construction materials and finishes – categories like paints, flooring materials (tiles, wood, resilient flooring), carpets, gypsum boards, concrete products, insulation, plumbing fixtures, HVAC equipment, electrical components, and furniture fixtures are included. However, coverage is uneven across categories:

* Furniture and Fixtures: Traditionally, BVB focused on “built-in” products, but over time, some furniture manufacturers have sought BVB ratings for their products too. For example, large Scandinavian office furniture companies (like Kinnarps or IKEA’s contract division) have several products in BVB. Still, loose furniture is a gap – many furniture items used in hotels (chairs, sofas, beds) are not BVB-rated, because the manufacturers might rely on other certifications (like EU Ecolabel or Möbelfakta) instead. Some have gotten on board: e.g., Luxaflex reports having about 200 of its fabric products accepted in BVB  
* [luxaflexproject-scandinavia.com](https://www.luxaflexproject-scandinavia.com/solutions/our-sustainable-certificates/#:~:text=Our%20sustainable%20certificates%20,fabrics%20in%20our%20project)  
* , and FM Mattsson (a faucet manufacturer) has a large number of products rated (mostly Accepted)  
* [fmmattsson.com](https://www.fmmattsson.com/environmental-assessments/byggvarubedomningen#:~:text=svg.svg%20%C2%A0Image%3A%20BVB)  
* . For hotel furniture, unless it’s custom-made by a supplier who knows BVB, it’s relatively uncommon to find a BVB rating. This means an interior designer specifying lobby furniture might not find those items in the BVB database.  
* Textiles (Carpets, Fabrics): Textile flooring (carpets) is a relevant category – some carpet manufacturers have BVB assessments, especially carpet tiles and rugs that target office use. For instance, Bolon (Swedish woven vinyl flooring) and Interface carpet tiles are known for environmental profiles and may appear in BVB via their distributors. However, decorative textiles (curtains, upholstery fabrics, bedding) are usually outside BVB’s scope. Those are more often covered by textile-specific ecolabels (like OEKO-Tex or Nordic Swan for textiles). So if a hotel spec asks for BVB on textiles, it might be hard to find many, and the specifier would instead use an alternative like requiring Nordic Swan Ecolabelled textiles or Standard 100 by OEKO-Tex for those items.  
* Lighting and Electronics: BVB has a special set of criteria for electronic products (because EU RoHS regulations and different chemical exemptions apply)  
* [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/assessments-according-to-electronic-criteria/#:~:text=Assessments%20according%20to%20electronic%20criteria,the%20requirements%20for%20substance)  
* . This suggests BVB *can* assess items like luminaires or appliances, but the uptake has been limited. Some lighting manufacturers focused on the Nordic market might have put a few fixtures through BVB, especially if they are used in offices. For hotels, architectural lighting (downlights, for example) could be BVB-rated if they are the same ones used in commercial buildings. But specialty decorative lighting or consumer electronics (TVs, mini-fridges) are typically not in BVB. So lighting fixtures coverage: common building fixture lines (like those from Fagerhult or Philips) might be present and rated Accepted (since they have to contain some electronics and plastics, often getting a yellow). Custom design pieces likely won’t be.  
* Sanitaryware and Bathroom/Kitchen: This category is relatively well-represented. Companies like Gustavsberg (Villeroy & Boch) have products assessed in BVB  
* [gustavsberg.com](https://www.gustavsberg.com/en/for-professionals/products-for-environmentally-certified-buildings/building-product-assessments#:~:text=Both%20%E2%80%9CByggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CSundaHus%E2%80%9D%20assess,provides%20a%20responsible%20supplier%20chain)  
* [gustavsberg.com](https://www.gustavsberg.com/en/for-professionals/products-for-environmentally-certified-buildings/building-product-assessments#:~:text=A%20selection%20of%20products%20that,Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen)  
* . Taps, toilets, shower components often appear, because they are fixed installations. Many of these products get *Accepted* ratings (due to minor brass alloy additives or such), but at least they’re in the system. In a hotel project, one can fairly readily find BVB-rated options for toilets, faucets, and shower fittings, as local suppliers have embraced it. Similarly, HVAC products (air diffusers, ducts, fan coil units) are often in BVB – e.g., Halton’s ventilation products are assessed (the Halton example we cited was an air valve with recycled content) – and these matter for hotel builds too (for guest room ventilation etc.).  
* Interior finishes: Almost all major categories like paints, varnishes, adhesives, flooring, acoustic panels, etc., have many BVB-rated options. In a hotel, things like wall paint and floor coverings will likely have BVB A or B choices available (paints are often Recommended now if low-VOC, and flooring might be Accepted/Recommended depending on material). Ceiling materials (like acoustic tiles) and partition walls also are widely covered. These tend to be straightforward because they are standard building products.

Gaps and Workarounds: The major *gaps* for a hotel interior, then, are furnishings and decorative elements that are not traditionally “building products.” When the desired product isn’t in BVB, project teams handle it in a few ways:

* Alternative Documentation: They may accept equivalent environmental documentation in lieu of a BVB rating. For example, if a particular chair is not BVB-rated but has a third-party eco-certification or a thorough Environmental Product Declaration (EPD), the client might accept that as evidence of environmental performance. We’ll discuss specific alternatives in the next section, but commonly accepted ones include EPDs, Nordic Swan or EU Ecolabel certifications, Cradle to Cradle certification, etc.  
* “Or Equal” Clauses: Specifications often are written to require BVB *or equal.* This means a contractor could propose a substitute product that isn’t BVB-rated but must prove it meets equivalent criteria (no harmful chemicals, low emissions, certain recycled content). For instance, if the spec calls for “BVB Recommended carpet, or equal,” the contractor could submit a carpet with a Cradle to Cradle Silver certification and documentation of no SVHC, which the client team might approve as an “equal” even without an official BVB label.  
* Custom Assessment / Project-Specific Approval: In some cases, if a preferred product lacks a BVB rating, the project team can encourage the supplier to get the product assessed. If the project timeline allows, the supplier might apply to BVB during the project. (This can take some weeks, so it requires foresight.) The cost-benefit of doing this depends on the project scale – for a large hotel chain rollout, a supplier might invest in BVB assessment to become a listed “accepted” product for future jobs. For a one-off boutique item, that’s less likely. If time is short, sometimes an environmental consultant on the project will do an *unofficial assessment* by comparing the product’s known info to BVB criteria and advising the client whether it *would* likely pass. However, this wouldn’t give an official rating, it’s just an internal risk check.  
* Exceptions and Client Decisions: Ultimately, if a specified product is not rated and no equivalent can be found, the client has to decide whether to allow it as an exception. Some clients say “if it’s not in BVB, it’s not allowed, period,” forcing the design team to find alternatives. Other clients might allow a small percentage of non-rated items if justified (for example, unique antique decor or a specialty imported tile that has other certifications). The trend though is that each year, fewer exceptions are needed as more manufacturers join BVB or similar databases. The BVB Industry Report notes a significant reduction in “To be avoided” products being used  
* [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/about-us/industry-report-2025/#:~:text=Between%202017%20and%202023%2C%20the,half%20during%20the%20same%20period)  
* [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/about-us/industry-report-2025/#:~:text=Between%202017%20and%202023%2C%20the,half%20during%20the%20same%20period)  
*  – implying the supply of acceptable products has grown and project teams are indeed able to find compliant materials more easily now than a few years ago.

In hospitality specifically, soft furnishings and bespoke design elements remain the area where sustainability teams need to put in extra effort. A practical approach some hotel developers take is to focus BVB requirements on the major volume materials (walls, floors, built-ins, casework, plumbing, etc.) and for the FF\&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment) that are outside BVB, use other criteria (like require low-emitting furniture under LEED, or FSC-certified wood for casegoods, etc.). This way, the project still captures the intent of BVB (avoiding harmful substances and favoring sustainability) even if the formal label isn’t on every piece of furniture. Cost and Benefit Considerations: Requiring BVB-rated products doesn’t usually add direct cost to the project (the database usage is handled through memberships), but it can influence product selection which in turn might affect cost. For instance, a BVB Recommended paint might be a standard product with no cost premium (many common paints now meet that). But a BVB Recommended flooring might exclude some cheaper options that have not been assessed or that contain PVC with certain additives – thus pushing the spec towards perhaps a slightly more expensive product. On balance, many common building products in Sweden have at least an Accepted rating with no cost difference. For higher ratings, sometimes the more *environmentally optimized* product can cost a bit more (e.g., a flooring with all recycled content and no phthalates might cost more than a generic one). It’s hard to generalize, but clients should be made aware that insisting on top-tier ratings could narrow choices. However, the market response has been strong, and competition among suppliers to achieve BVB approvals has grown; this keeps any cost impact minimal. Also, there is long-term value in using BVB-approved products: fewer regulatory risks, better indoor air (which in a hotel means better guest experience), and potentially insurance or financing benefits for having a “healthy building.” These benefits often outweigh any small upfront cost differences. In summary, hotels in Sweden increasingly incorporate BVB principles, especially on the construction side. Most structural and interior construction materials can be obtained with BVB ratings (A or B). The challenge areas are furniture and decor, where the industry is still catching up. When those are not covered, project teams resort to equivalent certifications or, if the client is flexible, accept a credible alternative documentation.

## **Incorporating BVB into Specifications – Toolkit for Fyra**

For a design firm like Fyra, which produces specifications for projects, integrating BVB requirements means translating the BVB criteria into clear, enforceable spec language. The goal is to help Fyra include BVB and circular economy criteria in their hotel project specs in a way that contractors and suppliers can understand and comply with. Below is a “Specifier Toolkit” with example specification clauses for common product categories, guidance on acceptable alternatives, and a framework for addressing reused products. These can be adapted to project-specific needs:

### **Example Specification Language by Product Category**

The following are template specification clauses that Fyra could use for various product categories in a hotel project. Each clause ensures that either the product is BVB-rated or meets an equivalent environmental performance standard. The clauses also incorporate circular economy criteria like recycled content, take-back programs, and necessary technical requirements (like fire safety and emissions).

* Seating Furniture (Chairs, Sofas, etc.): *All seating furniture shall be BVB-rated “Recommended (A)” or “Accepted (B)”, OR demonstrate equivalent environmental performance through approved documentation.* Each furniture piece must contain a minimum of 30% recycled content by weight. The manufacturer shall have a verified take-back or recycling program for furniture at end-of-life. Fire safety: Upholstered seating must meet at least Euroclass B-s2,d0 fire rating (or national equivalent).  
* Casework & Tables (Built-in joinery, loose tables): *Wood-based products (joinery, tables) should be BVB-rated A or B, OR carry a FSC/PEFC certification and low-emission finish equivalent to BVB criteria.* At least 70% of wood content must come from sustainably certified sources. Composite wood panels shall be E1 low-formaldehyde or better. Recycled content: Provide products with recycled or reclaimed wood content where feasible (e.g., particleboard with recycled wood fibers). All adhesives and finishes used must be free of BVB-prohibited substances (no added PVC or halogenated flame retardants).  
* Flooring – Textile (Carpets/Rugs): *All textile flooring (broadloom carpet or carpet tiles) shall be BVB-rated “Recommended (A)” OR certified by a recognized ecolabel (e.g., Nordic Swan Ecolabel, EU Ecolabel, or Cradle to Cradle certification) demonstrating equivalent performance.* Carpets must contain minimum 50% recycled content by weight (fiber and/or backing) to support circular material use. Indoor air quality: Carpet products shall have low VOC emissions, compliant with ISO 16000 indoor air class A (or CRI Green Label Plus). Fire classification: Textile flooring shall meet Euroclass Bfl-s1 (flame spread and smoke) or better for fire safety in exit routes.  
* Flooring – Hard (Wood, Laminate, PVC, etc.): *Hard floor finishes should be BVB-rated A or B, OR have a verified Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and comply with the Basta or SundaHus criteria for chemical safety.* PVC flooring (if used) must be phthalate-free and preferably have recycled PVC content. Wood flooring must be FSC-certified and low-emission (with water-based finishes). The product shall be free of substances on BVB’s Avoid list (e.g., no heavy metal additives). A minimum 10-year warranty on the finish is required to ensure durability (promoting long life).  
* Wall/Ceiling Finishes (Paints, Panels): *All paints, coatings, and surface finishes shall be BVB Recommended or carry an equivalent Type 1 ecolabel (such as Nordic Swan).* Paints must be zero or low VOC (meeting BVB’s VOC criteria – typically \<1 g/L for wall paints  
* [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=content%20and%20lifecycle,red)  
* ). Any wall paneling or acoustic panels shall be BVB-rated or meet M1 emission class for building materials. Recycled content in gypsum or acoustic boards is encouraged (specify “gypsum boards with minimum 20% recycled gypsum content”).  
* Lighting Fixtures: *All built-in lighting fixtures (downlights, sconces, etc.) shall be BVB-rated “Accepted (B)” or higher, OR provide equivalent documentation such as an EPD and evidence of compliance with EU RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances).* Design for disassembly: Luminaires must be designed such that components (LED driver, LED module, housing) are separable to facilitate recycling or replacement. The manufacturer should operate a take-back program or WEEE-compliant recycling for end-of-life fixtures. Energy efficiency: Only use LED technology with efficacy ≥ 100 lumens/W to reduce operational impacts. Fixtures shall contain no substances on the BVB exclusion list (e.g., no PCB-based capacitors, mercury, etc., aside from allowable lamp mercury in LEDs which is zero).  
* Plumbing Fixtures: *All plumbing fittings (faucets, showers) and sanitaryware must be BVB-rated A or B OR meet the criteria of BVB via alternate proof (e.g., compliance with KIWA or SINTEF health certifications, material disclosure, and EPD).* Products should have lead-free or low-lead content (e.g., lead-free brass) in line with BVB’s Accepted level for chemical content. Recyclability: Metallic components should be easily separable – for instance, faucets composed mainly of brass and stainless steel, which are recyclable. Packaging should be minimal and recyclable; suppliers with packaging take-back or using 100% recycled cardboard are preferred.  
* HVAC Equipment: *Ventilation units, air grilles, and other HVAC products should be selected from BVB-assessed products where available (A or B rating) or comply with Eurofins Indoor Air Comfort Gold certification and have full material disclosure.* They should contain no BFRs (brominated flame retardants) in plastic parts unless absolutely necessary and then must meet RoHS. All insulation materials in equipment (like acoustic insulation) should be free of CFC/HFC blowing agents and have an EPD.

These examples illustrate how to weave BVB requirements into spec language. The key is to always allow an “or equivalent” pathway so as not to exclude good products that, for whatever reason, aren’t formally in BVB. By listing concrete alternate standards (EPD, Swan, C2C, etc.), the spec gives contractors clear guidance on what counts as equivalent performance.

### **Acceptable Alternative Documentation (“Equivalents”)**

For products that do not have a BVB rating, Fyra should define what alternative evidence will be accepted to demonstrate equal environmental performance. This ensures that if a product isn’t in the BVB database, the contractor knows how to prove it’s still a green choice. Here is a framework for alternative compliance:

* Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs): A third-party verified EPD to EN 15804 standards is a strong piece of evidence. An EPD discloses the product’s lifecycle environmental impacts (carbon footprint, etc.) and often includes material composition. Specs can say: *“If a product is not BVB-rated, the supplier shall provide an ISO 14025 Type III Environmental Product Declaration*  
* [*byggvarubedomningen.com*](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=2,2)  
*  *plus supporting documents showing compliance with BVB chemical requirements.”* While an EPD alone doesn’t guarantee no hazardous substances, the combination of EPD and a safety datasheet can cover much of the criteria.  
* Type I Ecolabels (Third-Party Certifications): Accept well-recognized ecolabels that have rigorous criteria. Examples:  
  * Nordic Swan Ecolabel – for relevant product groups (paints, textiles, furniture, cleaning products). The Swan label ensures low toxicity, recycled content, and quality, often paralleling BVB’s goals.  
  * EU Ecolabel – the EU Flower covers many products (e.g., floor coverings, textiles, paints) with criteria on chemicals, recycled content, etc.  
  * Cradle to Cradle Certified – a multi-attribute label explicitly focused on circular economy (material health, reutilization, renewable energy, water stewardship, social fairness). A product with C2C Silver or higher is usually very aligned with circular economy: it has material health transparency and often design for recycling. C2C Gold or Platinum would exceed BVB requirements in many ways.  
  * Blue Angel (Der Blaue Engel) – a German label for products like furniture, electronics, with strict chemical and sometimes circular criteria (e.g., office chairs with Blue Angel have replaceable parts and recycled content).  
  * Möbelfakta (for furniture) – a Swedish furniture label that covers quality, environment, and social aspects (it includes requirements for material transparency and hazardous substances, which could serve in absence of BVB).  
* If a product carries one or more of these certifications, the spec can allow it as an equivalent to a BVB Accepted rating. For a BVB Recommended equivalence, one might require *multiple* certifications or higher tiers (e.g., *“Product not in BVB will be acceptable if it is Nordic Swan Ecolabelled and has an EPD available”* or similar, to cover both content and lifecycle).  
* Basta or SundaHus Registration: In Sweden, Basta and SundaHus are parallel systems focusing on chemicals. Basta is a self-declaration system where products meet certain chemical exclusion criteria (co-owned by IVL)  
* [byggforetagen.se](https://byggforetagen.se/app/uploads/2020/01/Materialdatabaserokt2012.pdf#:~:text=BASTA%20drivs%20som%20ett%20aktiebolag,sk%C3%B6ts%20av%20personal%20inom)  
* . If a product is listed in Basta, it means it has no prohibited substances above thresholds, which roughly corresponds to meeting BVB’s chemical content requirements (likely at least an Accepted level). SundaHus provides A, B, C+, C-, D ratings (A being best)  
* [gustavsberg.com](https://www.gustavsberg.com/en/for-professionals/products-for-environmentally-certified-buildings/building-product-assessments#:~:text=Within%20the%20%E2%80%9CByggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%E2%80%9D%2C%20each%20product,assessments%3B%20Recommended%2C%20Accepted%20or%20Avoided)  
* . A product rated A or B in SundaHus could be considered equivalent to a BVB Accepted/Recommended (though criteria differ slightly). Specs can note: *“Products not BVB-rated must at minimum fulfill the Basta criteria for chemical content, evidenced by a Basta registration, or have a SundaHus rating of C+ or better.”* This ensures the item isn’t bringing nasty chemicals even if it’s not formally in BVB.  
* ISO 14001 Manufacturer & Product Documentation: If no formal label is present, one fallback is requiring the manufacturer to be ISO 14001 certified (environmental management system) and provide a comprehensive *product sustainability dossier*. This dossier would include full material disclosure (perhaps in the form of a *Byggvarudeklaration* or product data sheet), test reports for emissions (like a VOC chamber test), and compliance statements (e.g., “complies with REACH, RoHS, does not contain listed SVHCs”). While this approach is more work to review, it gives a path for, say, a small boutique manufacturer to show their product is “clean” without an official BVB rating.  
* Material Health Certificates / Transparency Labels: There are labels like the Declare label (from ILFI) which is effectively a “nutrition label” for building products, listing all ingredients. If a product has a Declare label with no Red List chemicals, it indicates it contains no worst-in-class substances, aligning with BVB’s avoidance of hazardous content. Similarly, Cradle to Cradle Material Health Certificate (which focuses purely on chemical safety) could be used. These don’t cover recycled content or end-of-life, but they cover the toxicity aspect thoroughly. In combination with an EPD, they could approximate a BVB assessment.

To make this practical, Fyra can create an “Equivalency Matrix” that maps BVB ratings to acceptable alternatives. For example:

* BVB Recommended (A / “Recommended”): Product should have *either* a Nordic Swan or EU Ecolabel and meet at least one of: Cradle to Cradle Certified (Silver or above), Declare label (Red List Free), or equivalent. It should also have an EPD or documented recycled content to show it excels in lifecycle. Essentially, to claim “equivalent to BVB A,” the product should check multiple high-sustainability boxes (health \+ circularity). Only a handful of products might meet this, which is fine since BVB A itself is rare.  
* BVB Accepted (B / “Accepted”): Product can be accepted if it has at least one robust certification (Swan, EU Ecolabel, C2C Bronze, etc.) or if it at least meets all legal requirements and basic criteria. For instance, an EPD \+ compliance with REACH (no SVHC) could be considered roughly B-level. Or a SundaHus B or C+ rating would correspond to BVB Accepted. Essentially, one strong certification or a combination of partial documentation would suffice here.  
* To be avoided (C / “Avoid”): In the spec, this is simply a disqualifier – if a product would fall in this category, it shouldn’t be proposed. For instance, any product containing asbestos, lead, or other banned chemicals, or one that has no environmental info at all, would clearly not meet any of the above alternative criteria either. So this matrix mainly guides the upper two tiers.

Fyra can include a table in their guidelines for internal use, for example:

| BVB Rating | Acceptable Equivalents |
| ----- | ----- |
| Recommended (A) | Nordic Swan or EU Ecolabel \+ EPD; OR Cradle to Cradle Certified (Silver/Gold); OR equivalent demonstrating ≥50% recycled content and no hazardous substances. |
| Accepted (B) | Basic EPD OR Green Building rating (e.g. LEED compliant low-VOC \+ REACH compliance); OR SundaHus C+ or B; OR manufacturer self-declaration meeting Basta. |
| Avoid (C) | *No acceptable equivalent – such products must be excluded or substituted.* |

(This is just an illustrative matrix – in practice, one would flesh out exact certifications per category.)

### **Reused Products and “Equivalent Performance” Documentation**

Since reused or salvaged products do not come with a BVB rating, Fyra should provide a path in specs to allow them when they offer clear environmental benefit. It’s important to set criteria so that reused items are safe and truly better for the environment in that context. Here’s how Fyra might frame it:

* General Policy (Spec Clause): *“Reused or reclaimed products may be considered equivalent to new BVB-rated products provided they meet project performance requirements and are supported by documentation demonstrating environmental and health compliance.”*

For any reclaimed item (furniture, lighting, even structural elements), require the following documentation:

* Safety and Functionality Proof: The item must meet all structural, fire safety, and code requirements as if it were new. For example, reused furniture should be structurally sound (provide a refurbishment report or engineering check if applicable) and meet fire codes (e.g., upholstery passes required fire tests, or the item is exempt due to being existing).  
* Hazardous Materials Check: Conduct testing or obtain documentation to ensure the reused product does not contain prohibited substances. For instance, if reusing ceiling tiles, test one for asbestos just in case; for an old chair, verify it doesn’t have foam with banned flame retardants (maybe by documentation from that era or by a chemical test). This is crucial to align with BVB’s toxin-free goal.  
* Embodied Carbon Calculation: This is a key advantage of reuse – avoiding new manufacturing. The spec can ask for a simple embodied carbon saving calculation. E.g., use a tool or EPD data to estimate how much CO₂ is saved by reusing this item versus producing a new one. If the calculation shows, say, a 60% reduction in carbon footprint, that’s a strong justification.

An example specification line for reused furniture:

*“Reclaimed furniture pieces (e.g., vintage chairs, reused casegoods) may be submitted for approval in lieu of new BVB-rated items. Such items shall: (1) Be proven to meet relevant safety standards (structural integrity and fire performance for their use class); (2) Be free of hazardous substances (testing or documentation must show compliance with current chemical safety standards, e.g., no brominated flame retardants in foam, no lead paint); and (3) Demonstrate at least 60% lower embodied carbon impact compared to an equivalent new product (provide lifecycle carbon analysis or literature data as evidence). When these conditions are met, the reused product will be considered as contributing to the project’s environmental goals equivalently to a BVB-recommended new product.”* The above language ensures that reuse is encouraged *responsibly*. It sets a quantitative target (60% carbon savings) to ensure significant benefit. (Why 60%? It’s somewhat arbitrary but implies more than half the impact is saved, which is substantial – many reused items can actually avoid 80-95% of carbon vs new, when considering raw material and manufacturing). It also flags the health check – we don’t want to reintroduce toxins under the banner of reuse. In practice, providing this route in the spec allows contractors to seek out salvage options or reuse existing furniture from an older hotel if it fits, without penalizing the project’s environmental rating. It also challenges them to gather the info to prove it’s safe and green, thereby not compromising the intentions of BVB.

### **Client Communication and Compliance Strategy**

When implementing these specifications, explaining BVB to clients and stakeholders is crucial. Many hotel clients outside Sweden may not know what BVB is, so Fyra should be prepared to communicate its value:

* Explain the Benefits: Emphasize that BVB-rated products contribute to a healthier indoor environment and reduce environmental risks. For a hotel, this means better air quality for guests and staff (since BVB pushes low-VOC, low-toxin materials) and alignment with the hotel’s sustainability branding. Also, using vetted materials reduces the risk of future liabilities – e.g., not having to remove materials later due to regulatory changes (as has happened with certain flame retardants or PVC substances). BVB essentially future-proofs the building in terms of material health  
* [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/about-us/industry-report-2025/#:~:text=,based%20on)  
* .  
* Health and Guest Experience: Draw the connection that BVB’s focus on eliminating harmful chemicals (like no phthalates, no formaldehyde beyond limits, etc.) means guests are not exposed to those pollutants. In a high-occupancy building like a hotel, this is important. One could mention: “BVB has contributed to a 74% reduction in use of high-VOC materials in Sweden  
* [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/about-us/industry-report-2025/#:~:text=Between%202017%20and%202023%2C%20the,half%20during%20the%20same%20period)  
* , which is directly tied to fewer issues like odor, irritation, and long-term health hazards in buildings.”  
* Environmental Impact: Communicate the circular benefits as well – many BVB-approved products have recycled content and are designed to be recycled, which fits into corporate responsibility goals around resource efficiency. For example, “this carpet meets BVB criteria and contains 60% recycled yarn, saving X tons of virgin plastic.” Clients often respond well to concrete stats.  
* Cost Implications: Clients will ask if this raises costs. The answer can be nuanced: *Many BVB-compliant products are available at similar cost to traditional products.* There might be instances of slight premium, but overall in Sweden the market has adapted so that choosing an A or B rated product often does not mean choosing the most expensive option  
* [eco-institut.de](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/#:~:text=Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen%20provides%20a%20platform%20for,informed%20decisions%20about%20sustainable%20building)  
* [eco-institut.de](https://www.eco-institut.de/en/portfolio/byggvarubedoemningen-bvb-schweden/#:~:text=entire%20life%20cycle,informed%20decisions%20about%20sustainable%20building)  
* . It might mean avoiding the cheapest, least sustainable option – but often that lowest-end product would have other issues (quality, longevity) that the client would want to avoid anyway in a high-traffic environment like a hotel. One can highlight any cost-neutral swaps: e.g., “We specified a BVB-Recommended wall paint that cost the same as a conventional paint but has negligible VOC emissions.” If some items do come at a premium (maybe a particular eco-certified furniture line), frame it as a value: better durability or brand image. Also mention potential life-cycle cost savings: fewer material failures or replacements, and possibly insurance or marketing benefits. Some clients find that having a thoroughly “green” building allows them to market it (for example, a hotel might get a sustainability certification that attracts eco-conscious travelers).  
* Compliance Strategy: Let the client know that Fyra will handle the complexity by using these spec clauses. That means the contractor will be contractually obligated to provide products that meet these criteria, and they’ll have to submit documentation for approval. It’s good to explain that a bit: “During construction, we will collect all the product data (through BVB or equivalent forms) and compile a logbook of materials. This way, at handover, you (the client) receive documentation of all key materials and their ratings.” This reassures the client that the spec isn’t just paper – there’s a plan to enforce it and an end benefit (the logbook, which is a deliverable in many green building projects).  
* Risk Mitigation: Framing BVB as risk management can resonate with investors or owners. For example: *“By requiring BVB or equivalent, we ensure no problematic chemicals (like asbestos, SVOCs, etc.) are hidden in the building. This avoids expensive surprises down the line, like a material that off-gasses and triggers complaints, or something that can’t be recycled at renovation.”* Hotels, being 24/7 public environments, are especially sensitive to such issues (imagine having to close rooms due to a flooring emitting odors – BVB compliance helps avoid that by pre-vetting for low emissions).  
* Industry Standing: If the client is not Swedish, mention that BVB is one of the leading building material sustainability systems in Scandinavia, analogous to having a rigorous materials selection policy. It could improve their ESG scores or help with certification such as LEED (LEED v4 actually accepts local labels like BVB for material ingredients reporting).

In essence, the communication should be positive: using BVB makes the project *better* without greatly increasing cost, and Fyra has the knowledge to implement it smoothly. It’s an added value service that can differentiate Fyra and give the client confidence that their hotel will meet high sustainability standards.

## **Advocacy and Future Developments**

Finally, looking beyond immediate project specs, there are opportunities for Fyra to advocate for improvements in BVB and to be aware of other systems that promote circular economy in construction. Identified Gaps in BVB: While BVB is comprehensive, our analysis uncovered a few areas where it could evolve further to fully support circular economy goals:

* Integration of Reused Products: As discussed, the inability to formally rate or include reused building products is a gap. In a truly circular economy, reusing elements (from structural steel to interior fittings) is crucial, so BVB will eventually need a methodology to account for this. Perhaps a new category or a simplified assessment for reused components (focusing on safety and absence of toxins) could be developed. Currently, reused items are effectively outside the system, which might inadvertently discourage reuse in projects chasing full compliance. Fyra can raise this point in industry forums – there is room for BVB to at least acknowledge reused materials with a label like “R” (for Reviewed Reuse) or similar in the future.  
* Dynamic Lifespan and Durability Factors: BVB criteria don’t explicitly give credit for longer product lifespan or upgradability. A product that is very durable (20+ year life) or that has a service model (e.g., carpet tiles that can be swapped out) is inherently more circular. BVB touches on this indirectly (e.g., maintenance instructions imply it’s meant to last), but a gap is that a product that’s disposable after 5 years and one that lasts 30 years could both get Recommended if their content is benign. Perhaps future criteria could incorporate expected service life or warranty length as a positive factor.  
* Material Recovery Verification: BVB assumes recyclability based on design/material, but doesn’t verify if in practice the material gets recycled. For true circular economy, actual reclamation rates matter. This is outside BVB’s current scope (which focuses on product design, not post-installation fate). However, they could collaborate with initiatives or require manufacturers to report take-back performance data.  
* Emerging Circular Metrics: Concepts like Carbon footprint and Climate impact are not directly scored in BVB (though an EPD is asked for, the GWP value in it isn’t translated to the rating explicitly). As climate and circularity are intertwined, BVB might consider adding criteria for embodied carbon (e.g., rewarding products with significantly lower CO₂ than the sector average). Also, content of renewable materials is considered (we saw a criterion for ≥50% renewable content  
* [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=1,Recommended%20Renewable%20raw%20materials%20%E2%89%A550)  
* ), which is good, but perhaps BVB could push further on non-renewable resource depletion metrics or design for modularity explicitly. These are areas for growth.

How Fyra (and others) Can Influence BVB: BVB’s criteria are developed by a group of experts primarily from its member companies, which are mostly property owners and large construction firms

[byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=content%20and%20lifecycle,red)

. As an interior architecture firm, Fyra could influence indirectly by:

* Joining Industry Groups: Becoming a member of networks such as the Sweden Green Building Council (SGBC) or other sustainability forums where BVB development is discussed. SGBC events often cover materials and circularity; Fyra can voice the need for rating reused products or other improvements there.  
* Collaboration with IVL / BVB for Pilots: IVL (the Environmental Research Institute) often runs pilot projects and research on circular construction. Fyra could partner in a pilot to, for example, document a case study of a project using 30% reused furnishings and propose a way to evaluate them. If results are shared with BVB, it might pave the way for criteria adjustments.  
* Feedback to BVB: BVB has contact points and perhaps open consultations when updating criteria (which seems to happen roughly annually or bi-annually). Fyra can send in formal comments. Even though Fyra isn’t a property owner, as a user of the system (specifier relying on it), their feedback is valuable. Emphasize client demands: e.g., “We have clients asking why reused items are penalized – can BVB address this?” Such feedback shows BVB the market expectations.  
* Educating Clients: By consistently implementing BVB and circular specs in projects, Fyra helps normalize these requirements. Over time, contractors and suppliers also become more accustomed, easing implementation. The more projects that demand BVB or equivalent, the more manufacturers will get on board (which has been the virtuous cycle in Sweden so far). So simply by using it, Fyra is part of driving industry change.

Alternative Systems & Certifications: Besides BVB, it’s useful to know other systems in Sweden and internationally that focus on circularity:

* SundaHus and Basta: In Sweden, these are the two other material databases. SundaHus includes some circular aspects (like it flags if a product has an available EPD or not, and it also considers renewability of materials). Basta is purely about chemical safety (a product either meets the criteria or not). Neither is clearly “better” on circular economy than BVB; they are parallel tools often used together. Some projects require compliance with at least one of them. SundaHus’ A rating is roughly similar to BVB Recommended, but SundaHus places a bit more weight on the precautionary principle (it might give a lower rating if any data gaps).  
* Cradle to Cradle Certified (C2C): This is a product-level certification that many see as a gold standard for circular design. It evaluates material health, recyclability, use of renewable energy in production, water stewardship, and social fairness. A product with C2C certification (especially at higher levels like Silver, Gold) means it was designed for a circular economy (e.g., it contains x% recyclable content and is 100% technically or biologically recyclable). While C2C is not region-specific, its philosophy aligns well with circular goals. In some cases, using C2C-certified products might achieve what BVB is looking for and more. However, C2C is less known to contractors, so one would still need to verify specific criteria alignment.  
* Level(s) and DGNB: The EU’s Level(s) framework is a building-level assessment tool that includes circular economy indicators (like how much of a building’s materials are recyclable, or adaptable design). It’s not a product rating, but it might influence future product expectations (e.g., a building aiming for high circularity might demand a percentage of reused content, which ties back to products).  
* Green Building Certifications: Systems like LEED, BREEAM, and WELL have begun integrating material and circular criteria. LEED v4.1 has credits for using products with EPDs, material ingredient disclosure (which BVB can help with), and reuse of materials. BREEAM (especially BREEAM-SE in Sweden) often cites using databases like BVB to meet certain criteria (for instance, BREEAM’s Mat 01 credit can leverage BVB for responsible sourcing, and BREEAM’s Hea 02 on VOC can be met by using low-emission products which BVB identifies). Miljöbyggnad, the Swedish building cert, requires documentation of all materials (which BVB’s logbook facilitates). So awareness of these helps Fyra double-count efforts – if they do BVB, they likely also satisfy these certification needs.  
* Product Category Rules – Circular: Some industries have their own standards focusing on circularity. For example, EU regulations on construction products are moving towards including circular criteria (there’s talk of “recycled content mandates” for certain products by 2025/2030). Being ahead of that curve by using BVB/circular specs can future-proof Fyra’s projects.

Fyra can use knowledge of these systems to pick products that satisfy multiple requirements: e.g., a certain flooring might have a C2C certification (for circularity) and also a BVB Recommended rating – that’s a win-win and can be highlighted to clients. Future Outlook: The building industry is moving toward greater circularity, and tools like BVB will continue to adapt. We can expect BVB to possibly incorporate more climate-related metrics (perhaps a carbon intensity limit for Recommended in the future) and to work on harmonizing with EU initiatives (like the upcoming Digital Product Passport concept). Fyra should stay updated on BVB criteria updates (they release new versions and industry reports annually). Perhaps BVB will also expand into more product types – if hospitality sector voices demand it, maybe more furniture and fixture assessments will come. Fyra could even propose a partnership with BVB to develop a pilot “BVB Interiors” extension that focuses on furniture and decor items common in commercial interiors. This could plug the current gap and would be a cutting-edge development in Scandinavia. Finally, it’s worth mentioning any international best practices BVB could learn from: For example, the Netherlands has a database (NMD) focusing on environmental life-cycle scores of materials in buildings (to comply with regulations on carbon). Also, Finland’s M1 indoor air label ensures low emissions (which BVB includes as VOC criteria). France now has a law requiring a certain amount of reused materials in public projects. Sharing these trends with the BVB community can spur new criteria addressing those aspects (like incentivizing use of X% reused components). In conclusion, Fyra is well-positioned to use BVB not just as a compliance tool, but as a driver of innovation in hotel sustainability. By writing strong specs now, keeping an open dialogue with BVB and industry groups, and leveraging alternative systems where needed, Fyra can deliver hotel projects that are both cutting-edge in design and exemplary in circular economy performance.

## **Deliverable Structure**

To wrap up, here is a recommended structure for the final deliverables, incorporating the above research:

* BVB Overview Report (approx. 3-5 pages): This document would summarize what BVB is, how it works, and its relevance. It should include:  
  * An introduction to BVB (purpose, who administers it, voluntary nature, adoption in Sweden)  
  * [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/about-us/#:~:text=About%20us%20,About%20us)

  * .  
  * The rating system explained (A/Recommended, B/Accepted, C/Avoided and what they mean)  
  * [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=An%20environmental%20assessment%20by%20Byggvarubed%C3%B6mningen,red)  
  * .  
  * Key criteria and how circular economy factors are included (recycled content, reuse, recyclability thresholds)  
  * [halton.com](https://www.halton.com/app/uploads/2020/08/ByggvarubedC3B6mning20-20Halton20DRV.pdf#:~:text=3,Recycled%20material%20Material%20Percentage)  
  * [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/media/1yifbykg/criteria-73.pdf#:~:text=Material%20recycling%20is%20possible%20for,of%20the)  
  * .  
  * The assessment process (who submits, cost, etc.) and current usage in industry (with any stats of adoption).  
  * Specific notes on usage in hospitality projects (if available, e.g., any case examples or common practice).  
  * Strengths of BVB (e.g., chemical rigor, industry acceptance) and any noted weaknesses (like limited scope for reused items).  
  * This report serves to educate the team/client on BVB fundamentals with citations and factual backing.  
* Specifier Toolkit (approx. 5-8 pages): A practical guide for integrating BVB in specifications. It would contain:  
  * Template specification clauses for different product categories (as drafted above for furniture, textiles, lighting, etc.), possibly organized by CSI MasterFormat or similar structure for ease of use.  
  * An “equivalency matrix” or list that maps BVB ratings to acceptable alternative certifications (e.g., *“BVB A \= Nordic Swan or C2C Gold; BVB B \= EU Ecolabel or EPD \+ REACH compliance; etc.”*).  
  * Guidelines for handling products outside the BVB system, including reused products. This part would outline what documentation to ask for and provide example wording to include in specs for reused items (like the requirement for 60% carbon savings and safety proof).  
  * Tips for submittals: e.g., include a requirement that the contractor must submit the BVB product ID or the assessment summary for each item, or if not available, the alternative documents (EPD, certificates). This ensures during construction submittal phase, there’s a checkpoint.  
  * Perhaps a checklist for spec writers: “When writing a spec section, have you added: BVB rating requirement? Recycled content minimum? VOC requirement? Fire class? Alternative compliance route?” – this can standardize the inclusion of these criteria.  
  * This toolkit essentially becomes Fyra’s internal resource (and could be shared with clients/contractors to clarify expectations).  
* Quick Reference (1-2 pages): A cheat-sheet for quick info. This could include:  
  * A one-page diagram or table of BVB rating levels with their definitions and symbols (Green/Recommended, Yellow/Accepted, Red/Avoid) for easy reference  
  * [fmmattsson.com](https://www.fmmattsson.com/environmental-assessments/byggvarubedomningen#:~:text=%E2%80%9DRecommended%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9DAccepted%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9DAvoided%E2%80%9D)  
  * .  
  * Common product types and what BVB rating is typically achievable. For example:  
    * Paints: Typically Recommended (A) if low-VOC.  
    * Vinyl flooring: Often Accepted (B) due to plasticizers, few are Recommended unless biobased.  
    * Furniture: Many not rated; of those rated, mostly Accepted.  
    * This helps specifiers know where to set their expectations.  
  * “When to require BVB vs. alternative”: a short note saying if a product category is well-covered in BVB, always require it; if not, use alternative criteria. For instance, “Flooring, walls – require BVB. Loose furnishings – allow alternatives like Swan or EPD.”  
  * Could also list the top 10 suppliers or brands that have BVB-rated products in key categories as a quick help (e.g., list of carpet brands with BVB, etc., gleaned from project experience).  
  * Basically, this is something a designer can glance at during design development to quickly gauge how to approach material selection relative to BVB.  
* Appendices:  
  * Full BVB criteria reference: Either include the latest criteria document from BVB (if license allows) or provide a link/reference. For instance: *“See BVB Criteria Version 2022-1 for detailed thresholds (available on BVB’s website)*  
  * [*byggvarubedomningen.com*](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/support/faq/#:~:text=In%20the%20assessment%20of%20the,chemical%20content%20and%20lifecycle%20aspects)  
  * *.”*  
  * Contact info for BVB (address, website, support email) in case the team or suppliers need to reach out for clarifications or to start an assessment  
  * [byggvarubedomningen.com](https://byggvarubedomningen.com/assessments/#:~:text=Address)  
  * .  
  * Overview of alternative certification schemes: A brief description of each relevant one (EPD, Nordic Swan, Cradle to Cradle, etc.), so that team members or clients can understand those when we say “or equivalent (Nordic Swan, etc.)”.

By delivering these components, Fyra will have a comprehensive package. The overview educates all stakeholders on the “why” and “what” of BVB, the spec toolkit provides the “how” to implement it, and the quick reference & appendices serve as ongoing support tools. This structured approach will enable Fyra’s designers to confidently specify sustainable, circular products and will help clients and contractors to comply with these requirements, ultimately leading to hotel projects that meet high standards of environmental responsibility and circular economy principles.
