* ). Quality: Items are generally lightly used or showroom models; classified and sold “as is” but in good condition (they emphasize “think second hand first – good for planet and budget”  
* [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=Vi%20k%C3%B6per%2C%20s%C3%A4ljer%20och%20hyr,Och%20f%C3%B6r%20din%20budget)  
* ). Pricing: \~50% of new price (“halva nypriset” is their slogan). Volume discounts for bulk orders; also sells in “packages” by room type. B2B maturity: Very high – 100% B2B focus, 5,000+ corporate customers served. Experience with large projects (their news/blog has corporate cases). Possibly less hospitality-specific experience, but they do have “Café” and “Lounge” furniture categories which overlap with hospitality needs. Quality assurance: Basic functionality checks, cleaning; not as deep refurbishment, but items are in “very good or new” condition often. They offer standard returns/reclamation policies for used goods (no return unless defect, 2-year warranty for business customers on functionality)  
* [dpj.se](https://www.dpj.se/504-aterbruk?srsltid=AfmBOopxmu9ulY1f9LhkLVWFzxnA1JXmbgBW3f1b91wT7lCt6hhkqlsz#:~:text=produktbeskrivningen%20noga,inte%20reklamera%20varan%20f%C3%B6r%20de)

* . Compliance: For office use, likely can provide EN 1335 or EN 16139 info for chairs if requested. Fire compliance for soft furniture may be limited unless the original item was certified; they likely do not routinely re-upholster, so for hospitality fire codes, they might rely on inherent properties or could coordinate treating fabrics via partners if needed (not advertised, so would be a project-specific negotiation). Logistics: Own delivery network in Sweden (they list contact numbers per city  
* [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=%2A%20%20G%C3%B6teborg%3A%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0031,87%2049%2029)  
* ), can ship Nordic-wide; offer assembly services. Digital: Excellent online store with real-time stock and e-commerce ordering. No explicit API but they have a modern inventory system. Sustainability: They highlight climate impact on site (a “Climate impact” info page  
* [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=,Service%20%26%20reklamation)  
* ). Likely track kg of furniture reused. Possibly ISO14001 certified (they display ISO certificate icon  
* [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=Image%3A%20iso%20certificate%20%20,162)  
* ). Type: Type C (Inventory operator with large warehouses and showrooms; moderate refurbishment). Hospitality maturity: Level 2-3 – strong commercial experience but few direct hotel projects yet; however they have the capacity for chain hotel orders (uniform furniture in volume) given their inventory breadth. Geographic: Sweden-wide (3 main hubs), also serves Nordic via shipping. Price: Value/Mid-market – \~50% of new on average, with further discounts on bulk; very budget-friendly for large quantities of decent quality.  
* Input Interiör – Greenified – *Major contract furniture dealer with circular platform*. Input Interiör is Scandinavia’s largest independent interior solutions firm (41 showrooms). In recent years they launched Greenified, a circular marketplace for used furniture  
* [greenified.se](https://greenified.se/#:~:text=Greenified%20%E2%80%93%20En%20cirkul%C3%A4r%20m%C3%B6belmarknad,ett%20kostnadseffektivt%20och%20h%C3%A5llbart%20s%C3%A4tt)  
* . Scale: Input itself is huge (1000+ employees), and Greenified leverages that scale – inventory comes from big corporate or public clients’ furniture when they upgrade. Model: Marketplace & service – Greenified allows businesses to buy, sell or even rent used furniture via Input. Input offers renovation services (reupholstery, repairs) to bring used items to “near original condition”  
* [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/tjanster/aterbruk/#:~:text=Renovera%20befintliga%20eller%20begagnade%20m%C3%B6bler,omtapetsering%20eller%20byte%20av%20delar)  
*  and then lists them on Greenified. They also provide turnkey reuse services: managing office decommissioning (they handled complete liquidation of E.ON’s offices, diverting \~195 tons CO2e by reuse  
* [eon.se](https://www.eon.se/content/dam/eon-se/swe-documents/swe-sammanfattning-analys-kontorsflytt-2023.pdf#:~:text=,akt%C3%B6rer%20inte%20ska%20fokusera%20p%C3%A5)  
* ). Product range: broad – office, institutional furniture, some hotel furniture. Because Input serves high-end projects (law firms, etc.), Greenified inventory often includes premium design brands. They also mention a furniture rental option with reused items  
* [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/nyheter/hyr-aterbruk-med-greenified/#:~:text=Hyr%20%C3%A5terbruk%20med%20Greenified%20,vi%20alternativt%20att%20hyra)  
* . Volume: Can handle large projects (they manage entire building clear-outs, so hundreds of items). For a hotel, Input/Greenified could pool items from multiple sources. Quality: High – Input has in-house workshops or partners (they note furniture is refurbished close to original condition  
* [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/tjanster/aterbruk/#:~:text=Renovera%20befintliga%20eller%20begagnade%20m%C3%B6bler,omtapetsering%20eller%20byte%20av%20delar)  
* ). B2B focus: 100%. Many project references including offices where \>50% of furniture was reused via Input  
* [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/nyheter/aterbruk-i-praktiken-pa-kpmg/#:~:text=%C3%85terbruk%20i%20praktiken%20p%C3%A5%20KPMG,%C3%A5teranv%C3%A4nd%2C%20antingen%20direkt%20eller)  
* . Hospitality experience: Input Interiör itself regularly fits out hotels (with new furniture normally); with Greenified, they are starting to integrate reused pieces in such projects. For example, they were furniture partner for a hotel project in Norway focusing on reuse  
* [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/#:~:text=Input%20interi%C3%B6r%20Input%20interi%C3%B6r%20var,dlapipernorway%2C%20Norwegian%20design%20and)  
* . They understand contract-grade requirements well. Compliance: Very strong – they can provide all necessary certifications (since they also sell new contract furniture). Likely able to get fire testing for refurbished items (they work with RISE/SP labs if needed). Documentation: Full documentation available (they know EN standards, material data sheets, etc., from their new furniture side). Tech: Greenified is a digital platform (web marketplace); they even launched a Greenified Inventory app for clients to track their furniture assets for reuse  
* [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/nyheter/aterbruk-i-praktiken-pa-kpmg/#:~:text=50%20procent%20av%20inredningen%20%C3%A4r,%C3%A5teranv%C3%A4nd%2C%20antingen%20direkt%20eller)  
* . Potential API for large clients’ FM systems. Sustainability: Core to their pitch – they produce sustainability reports (e.g., for E.ON project they quantified CO2 saved  
* [eon.se](https://www.eon.se/content/dam/eon-se/swe-documents/swe-sammanfattning-analys-kontorsflytt-2023.pdf#:~:text=,akt%C3%B6rer%20inte%20ska%20fokusera%20p%C3%A5)  
* ). Likely ISO 14001\. They emphasize “closing the loop” partnerships. Type: Type A/B – acts as a hub with inventory and refurbishment, but also a platform connecting sellers and buyers. Hospitality maturity: Level 4 – They have regular hotel clients (as new supplier) and are transferring that to reuse; at least a few hotel projects with reused furnishings (so not as many as offices, but knowledge is there). Geographic: Nordic – Input operates in all Nordic countries; Greenified covers Sweden and extends to Nordics. Price: Mid/Premium – because they handle high-quality design items, prices can be 60–80% of new for those, but still cost-saving given the brands.  
* Recycling Partner (RP) – *Specialist in turnkey office reuse, emerging in hospitality*. Founded \~2001, private. Offices/showrooms in 8 cities (Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Uppsala, etc.  
* [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=,%C3%84ngelholm)

* [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=,FIA%20%E2%80%93%20m%C3%B6beldatabasen%20f%C3%B6r%20milj%C3%B6hj%C3%A4lten)  
* . B2B focus: 100%. Hospitality experience: Limited but possible – primarily offices so far, but they highlight creating “inspiring environments” and have done lounges and reception areas which parallel hotel lobbies. Likely Level 2-3 (commercial experience, learning curve for hotels). Strengths: Multi-city coverage, in-house logistics and assembly, integration of new and reused (so if something is unavailable used, they can supply new to complete a design). Compliance: Familiar with public-sector standards (they bid on public tenders). Can provide documentation on request. Might arrange fire treatment via Artex for fabrics if a hospitality client requires. Type: Type A/E – Full service, with niche strength in office furniture. Geographic: Sweden-wide (showrooms and warehouses regionally). Price: Mid-market – \~50–70% off new, flexible leasing options.  
* Place2Place – *Digital marketplace for quality second-hand furniture*. Startup (recent, \~2020). Platform for buying used home and office furniture online, targeting design-savvy customers. Model: Curates used furniture (from offices and individuals), lists with professional photos, offers bulk purchase support for businesses. They highlight “personal customer service, secure payment, smooth freight”  
* [place2place.se](https://place2place.se/?srsltid=AfmBOor3Gqj0TYth_bLwfMb2ucUBdZmSoqjsfDxdTpGj5Uvwe4ukeTL7#:~:text=Image%3A%20Personlig%20kundservice)  
* . Scale: Unknown exact volume, but listings show dozens of identical items (e.g. 68 Fritz Hansen chairs  
* [place2place.se](https://place2place.se/?srsltid=AfmBOor3Gqj0TYth_bLwfMb2ucUBdZmSoqjsfDxdTpGj5Uvwe4ukeTL7#:~:text=L%C3%A4gg%20i%20varukorg)

* ), implying they coordinate inventory storage or dropship from liquidators. Likely Stockholm-based but ships countrywide. Product range: Mix of office and some residential pieces, including lighting (lamps), sofas, chairs, tables, storage, etc. Many high-end brands appear (Fritz Hansen, Vitra, \&Tradition, Herman Miller, etc.  
* [place2place.se](https://place2place.se/?srsltid=AfmBOor3Gqj0TYth_bLwfMb2ucUBdZmSoqjsfDxdTpGj5Uvwe4ukeTL7#:~:text=)

* ). Quality: Emphasis on *“kvalitetsmöbler”* – likely only lightly used or vintage design items in good shape. Not clear if they refurbish or just select good condition pieces. B2B: They market to both home and office; B2B is a focus (they have a corporate sales approach for larger orders). Hospitality: Could be useful as a source of unique design pieces (their catalog has designer sofas, lamps that could outfit boutique hotel lounges). However, not specifically hospitality-experienced (likely Level 1-2). Logistics: They arrange freight; can deliver large orders in one go. No installation service mentioned (likely curbside delivery). Compliance: Minimal – more of an “as is” marketplace, so fire certification or guarantee of durability would need case-by-case checking (e.g. a Fritz Hansen chair likely meets contract standards by design). They probably do not provide fire treatment or documentation proactively. Type: Type D (Marketplace platform). Geographic: Sweden (based online, shipping coverage national). Price: Variable/Premium – items priced individually; some designer items at 50–80% of new, others rare pieces priced high (e.g. vintage sofa at 149k SEK  
* [place2place.se](https://place2place.se/?srsltid=AfmBOor3Gqj0TYth_bLwfMb2ucUBdZmSoqjsfDxdTpGj5Uvwe4ukeTL7#:~:text=L%C3%A4gg%20i%20varukorg)  
* ). Generally cost-saving for standard items.  
* DPJ Workspace (Återbruk section) – *Mainstream furniture retailer embracing reuse*. DPJ is a large office furniture retailer that added a used furniture outlet online  
* [dpj.se](https://www.dpj.se/504-aterbruk?srsltid=AfmBOopxmu9ulY1f9LhkLVWFzxnA1JXmbgBW3f1b91wT7lCt6hhkqlsz#:~:text=%C3%85terbruk)  
* . They primarily sell new, but their “Återbruk” page offers items that are ex-demo, lightly used, or with damaged packaging  
* [dpj.se](https://www.dpj.se/504-aterbruk?srsltid=AfmBOopxmu9ulY1f9LhkLVWFzxnA1JXmbgBW3f1b91wT7lCt6hhkqlsz#:~:text=match%20at%20L187%20och%20k%C3%B6ps,produkt%20som%20annars%20skulle%20sl%C3%A4ngas)  
* . Scale: DPJ is nationwide (offices in Stockholm), and their used selection is a subset. Likely smaller volumes of each item (since these are often open-box returns). B2B vs B2C: Serves both, but the reuse offering is clearly targeted at cost-conscious B2B (they explicitly mention office and design furniture in “återbruk”). Product range: Office chairs, desks, lamps, etc., all from their catalogue but in used condition. Quality: Classified by DPJ as *“Nyskick” (like new), “Mycket gott skick”* etc.  
* [dpj.se](https://www.dpj.se/504-aterbruk?srsltid=AfmBOopxmu9ulY1f9LhkLVWFzxnA1JXmbgBW3f1b91wT7lCt6hhkqlsz#:~:text=S%C3%A5%20h%C3%A4r%20klassificerar%20vi%20v%C3%A5ra,m%C3%B6bler%20f%C3%B6r%20%C3%A5terbruk)  
* . All functional; cosmetic flaws described. Volume: Limited identical quantities (because it depends on returns; e.g., they might have 5–10 of a model rather than 50). Contract experience: DPJ does fit-outs for offices regularly (with new furniture); they could integrate some used items if available. Hospitality: Minimal direct reuse experience (likely Level 1), though DPJ sells new hotel furniture as well. Compliance: They follow standard warranty (used items sold “as is” with no returns, but 2–3 year reclamation rights for defects)  
* [dpj.se](https://www.dpj.se/504-aterbruk?srsltid=AfmBOopxmu9ulY1f9LhkLVWFzxnA1JXmbgBW3f1b91wT7lCt6hhkqlsz#:~:text=produktbeskrivningen%20noga,inte%20reklamera%20varan%20f%C3%B6r%20de)  
* . They won’t provide fire certs for a used item unless it originally had one. Type: Type C (Inventory add-on within a retailer). Geographic: Sweden-wide (online). Price: Mid/Value – often \~30–50% off their new price. Good for opportunistic deals, but not a guaranteed supply for large projects.  
* Kompanjonen (Dacke Consulting) – *Circular economy consultant and broker*. Stockholm-based small firm (5 employees) focused on enabling reuse of building interiors and materials

* ; primarily serves small/mid-size property owners and contractors. Product scope: *Interior building materials* (doors, glass walls, flooring, lighting fixtures), furniture from office/hotel liquidations, and technical installations. For example, they might help a hotel under renovation sell its old room furniture in bulk, or source reclaimed light fixtures for a new project. Experience: 10+ years focusing on reuse in building sector

* ). Likely Level 3 – a few hotel-related projects (e.g., helped salvage materials from hotels or supply second-hand fixtures to hostels). Quality/QA: They perform on-site inspections (“återbruksinventering”) to assess condition and compliance of items before reuse. Work with partners for dismantling and testing (e.g., they might partner with RISE for material testing or with demolition companies for careful removal  
* [jarnbyggfarg.se](https://jarnbyggfarg.se/kompanjonen-i-braschen-for-aterbruk-av-byggmaterial/#:~:text=Kompanjonen%20I%20Br%C3%A4schen%20F%C3%B6r%20%C3%A5terbruk,projektet%20Centrum%20f%C3%B6r%20Cirkul%C3%A4rt)  
* ). Compliance: High awareness – can advise on fire safety, REACH chemicals, BVD documentation. They can arrange lab testing or fire-retardant treatment via partners if a client requires a reused item to meet standards (though it adds cost/time). Notable: Kompanjonen was behind establishing the “Återbrukshubben” pilot in Stockholm with Fabege, and is involved in the CCBuild network, pushing industry standards for reuse

* . Type: Type B (Sourcing specialist / consultant – minimal physical stock). Geographic: Based in Stockholm but operates nationwide (and even does projects in other Nordic countries via network)  
* [kompanjonen.se](https://kompanjonen.se/author/emmahakansson/#:~:text=Region)  
* . Price: Varies – They charge for services (consulting fees) and facilitate sales between parties (possibly commission-based). The cost of items is often low (since many are salvaged), but service costs for inventory and refurb must be factored. Good for custom sourcing of unique or large building components that others don’t stock.  
* Återbruksfabriken – *High-capacity hub for reclaimed building materials*. Founded \~2021 with backing from recycling firms (partners include PreZero, GoZero)

* ). Likely also furniture and lighting if from a demolition (though their emphasis is on building materials). Quality: Items are inventoried and stored professionally; many are *new overstock* (e.g., unused materials in original packaging) or used components in good condition. They provide documentation for environmental reporting (they mention giving clients docs to show their environmental work  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=Tj%C3%A4nster)  
* ). Volume: Can supply large quantities if they have it (e.g., a batch of identical ceiling panels or a set of doors from an office building). Their approach encourages projects to donate all surplus to the hub, so stock is project-based. B2B focus: 100% – clients are contractors, developers, architects. Hospitality projects: Potentially – e.g., if a hotel needs reclaimed wood flooring or glass partitions, Återbruksfabriken could supply if available. They are relatively new, but aiming for industrial scale reuse for future building code demands  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=P%C3%A5%20kort%20sikt%20fokuserar%20vi,att%20g%C3%A5%20direkt%20till%20deponi)  
* . Logistics: They offer pickup services (they will *come to site, collect material with their AI scanning tech*  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=2)  
* ) and can deliver sold materials. Possibly have just-in-time delivery to align with construction schedules (important for contractors to avoid storage on site). Compliance: They provide necessary material data – e.g., if selling structural elements, they ensure those meet safety standards or inform if not. Likely no formal certification on used structural parts (since that’s a legal challenge), but for interior non-structural, they can assist with material passports and EPD info if available. Traceability: Using a digital platform (integrated with inventories.io) that tracks items and their CO₂ savings

* . Type: Type A (Full-service reuse hub for building materials). Maturity: Level 2 (not hospitality-specific) – no known hotel-specific projects yet, but certainly capable for interior materials portion of a hotel build. Coverage: Sweden-wide (central location and logistics partners). Price: Value – prices are significantly lower than new (often 30–60% of new price for identical material, or even just cost of handling). They highlight cost savings and “win-win” for both donors and buyers

* . Products: Doors, windows, sanitary ware, hardware, lumber, etc., plus some furniture/lighting from building clear-outs. Volume: Inventory is highly variable; often one-off items or small batches. They likely cannot fulfill a requirement of 100 identical pieces but can be invaluable for *unique or vintage* elements (e.g., a batch of 10 antique doors, or replacement tiles). Quality: Varies from near-new to clearly used; they rely on visual grading. B2B: Many clients are individual renovators or small contractors, but also film/theater set designers, etc. For commercial projects, they have provided pieces for sustainable pilot projects. Hospitality: Best suited for boutique projects wanting character pieces (e.g. reclaimed wooden beams for a rustic lodge, or vintage doors for a boutique hotel). Not experienced with compliance-heavy supply (Level 1-2). Type: Type E (Niche specialist salvage). Geographic: Regional (Gothenburg). Price: Low – bargains for most items; typically priced to move stock.

* . Products: bricks, tiles, doors, windows, lumber, plumbing fixtures, etc. Focus on making it easy for anyone to find something for renovations. B2B vs B2C: Serves both (open to the public). Some local contractors use it for cost-saving on small jobs. Hospitality: If a hotel in Skåne needed some reclaimed material and sustainability is a goal, Återbyggdepå could be a resource, but they do not provide the full service of a commercial supplier (client must pick suitable items themselves). Type: Type A (Hub) but *public-sector run*. Maturity: Level 1 (not project-driven). Coverage: Just Malmö region (though anyone can buy if willing to transport). Price: Very low (often just nominal fees to cover handling).  
* Spirec AB – *Startup focusing on surplus wood and building supplies*. Founded 2022 by a young entrepreneur, based in Västerås region.

* . Likely limited staff. Clients: small builders, DIY, some larger firms testing their service. Hospitality: No direct experience; could supply materials if available (e.g., reclaimed wood floors or doors), but their capacity for consistent volume is unproven. Compliance: Will provide info on materials; new items have usual certifications, used items sold as-is (they note that some items are classified as reuse even if new but with damaged packaging

. Återbruket / Återbygget – local initiatives (e.g., NSR’s “Återbygget” in Helsingborg for leftover DIY materials). These contribute to the ecosystem but are not primary hospitality suppliers.)\* Summary of Operators: In Sweden, the reuse supply landscape is a mix of specialized private companies (Yllw, Rekomo, RP, etc.) that focus on furniture and fixtures, consultants/brokers (Kompanjonen) that facilitate reuse transactions, and hubs for building materials (Återbruksfabriken, municipal depots). Many started in the office sector but are extending into hospitality and other commercial arenas as demand grows. The next sections will evaluate these operators’ capabilities and categorize them for hospitality use.

## **B. Kategorisering & Typologi (Categorization & Typology)**

Here, each identified operator is classified by their operational model, hospitality maturity, geographic reach, and price positioning. This helps understand their role and suitability for various project needs: Operational Model Types:

* Type A – Full-Service Hub: Operators that provide end-to-end service: they maintain significant inventory, actively source on demand, perform refurbishment/testing, manage logistics, and even offer installation. *Examples:* YLLW Factory  
* [yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=H%C3%A5llbarhet%20p%C3%A5%20riktigt)  
*  (large stock \+ refurb factory \+ delivery/install), Återbruksfabriken (inventory \+ logistics for building materials), Input/Greenified (integrated inventory, refurb, and delivery via Input’s org), RP (multi-city inventory \+ in-house renovation \+ install). These are “one-stop shops” for reuse.  
* Type B – Sourcing Specialist: Those primarily focusing on finding and brokering items rather than holding inventory. They often provide consulting, inventory audits, and match-making. *Example:* Kompanjonen  
* [diva-portal.org](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1549635/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=3,att%20koppla%20ihop%20tillg%C3%A5ng%20och)  
*  – expert in connecting supply and demand, with digital platform but minimal own stock. Also Återbrukskonsulten/Återbygget similar roles. They excel at custom sourcing projects but may rely on partners for refurbishment and logistics.  
* Type C – Inventory Operator: Those with large warehouses of used items but less capability to source beyond their stock. They might have limited refurbishment (mostly clean and minor fixes). *Examples:* Rekomo (big showrooms of immediately available furniture), DPJ Återbruk (outlet stock only), Brattöns Återbruk (salvage yard inventory). They’re great for quick availability of what’s in stock, but if you need something they don’t have, they won’t proactively source elsewhere.  
* Type D – Marketplace Platform: Primarily digital platforms that facilitate transactions between third-party sellers and buyers, with minimal physical handling by the platform itself. *Examples:* Place2Place (online marketplace for used furniture, arranges logistics but doesn’t refurbish itself), CCBuild’s marketplace (online listings of materials from various contributors), and emerging platforms like Loopfront. They offer wide selection and scalability but require the buyer to handle vetting quality and sometimes coordinating condition checks.  
* Type E – Niche Specialist: Operators focusing on a single product category or niche with deep expertise. *Examples:* Yllw Factory could be both A and E (specialized in office furniture refurb at scale), Brattöns (specialist in reclaimed building materials in Gothenburg), Spirec (focus on wood/lumber reuse). Also, a lighting-specific reuse specialist if any (none standalone identified, but some lighting refurb shops exist). These players have deep knowledge in their niche (e.g., upholstery, or reclaimed wood grading) and can provide higher quality or unique products in that category.

Each operator can fall into multiple categories (e.g., Yllw is Type A and E for furniture; Input is A and D due to their platform aspect). This typology highlights their primary mode. Hospitality Maturity Levels:

* Level 5 – Hospitality-Ready Experts: These have a dedicated hospitality practice, with 10+ hotel projects delivered. They fully understand hotel compliance (fire codes, contract durability, etc.) and operations. They likely have references from major hotel chains or upscale properties. *Current status:* None of the identified reuse operators is clearly at Level 5 yet, as the concept of reused furnishings in hospitality is fairly new. However, Yllw Factory is approaching this – they have hospitality segment focus and at least several projects, indicating high readiness.  
* Level 4 – Regular Hospitality Experience: Operators with 5–10 hotel projects or similar, thus solid experience. They know typical requirements (e.g., CRIB5 fire standards for upholstery, need for 100+ uniform items, etc.) and have adapted processes to meet them. *Candidates:* YLLW Factory (they list hotel/restaurant references), Input/Greenified (through Input’s hotel projects experience, even if reused component is new), possibly Rekomo (they haven’t done hotels publicly, but have done large uniform fit-outs akin to hotels, e.g., student housing or large offices with similar scale).  
* Level 3 – Some Hospitality Exposure: Operators who have done a few (2–5) hospitality or similar projects or pilots. They have commercial project management skills and understand parts of hospitality needs but are still on the learning curve for certain specifics. *Examples:* Recycling Partner (RP) – known mostly for offices but could have done furniture for a small hotel lobby or conference center; Kompanjonen – may have consulted on a hotel renovation salvage; Place2Place – supplied furniture to a boutique hostel perhaps. They can adapt to hospitality with some guidance on specifics.  
* Level 2 – Commercial but Not Hospitality-Specific: Those with significant B2B experience (offices, public sector, retail) but no direct hotel project experience. They understand contracts and volume, but not the nuances of hotel safety, durability, and aesthetic branding requirements. *Examples:* Rekomo (as of now, no known hotel reference but very capable in B2B), Återbruksfabriken (construction sector experience, not hotel per se), Spirec (just starting with contractors), DPJ (experienced in selling to offices and maybe restaurants, but not hotels specifically). These would need support to meet hospitality compliance but have the basics (volume, QA) in place.  
* Level 1 – Minimal Commercial Experience: Perhaps those who mostly served residential or very small-scale clients. They have little knowledge of large project coordination. *Examples:* Brattöns Återbruk (serves individuals and small builders, not used to corporate processes), some local reuse shops. These could still supply goods but would not handle a hotel project’s complexity without significant assistance.

Geographic Coverage:

* Stockholm-Optimized: Operators with a major base in Stockholm area, which can easily serve projects in the capital region (and often ship elsewhere too). *Examples:* Kompanjonen (Stockholm-based), Input/Greenified (multiple showrooms, including Stockholm HQ), Rekomo (big Stockholm showroom), Yllw (sales office in Stockholm \+ Dalby warehouse can truck up). These have logistics tuned for Stockholm deliveries (important since many hospitality projects might be in Stockholm).  
* Sweden-Wide: Those with multiple locations or national logistics, covering all major regions. *Examples:* Rekomo (Gothenburg, Malmö, Stockholm branches), RP (8 locations across Sweden), Input (nationwide showrooms), PostNord or DHL integrated platforms like Place2Place (they use third-party freight to reach anywhere). Such operators can support hotel chains rolling out refurbishments in various cities or a project outside main metros.  
* South-Sweden Focus (Göteborg–Malmö axis): Operators concentrated in the southern half (where population is denser) and with less presence up north. *Examples:* Yllw Factory (Skåne and Småland presence, can serve up to Stockholm easily but far north might be harder without partners), Återbruksfabriken (Sörmland – central/south location), Brattöns (Gothenburg region only), Malmö Återbyggdepå (just Skåne). These might struggle to serve a project in, say, Umeå or Luleå except via shipping.  
* Regional/Local: Those really operating in one region and not geared for beyond. *Example:* Brattöns (just West Sweden), some small municipal depots. They are best for projects in their vicinity.  
* Nordic: Operators that operate in multiple Nordic countries or at least regularly ship across borders. *Examples:* Rekomo (explicitly says they serve entire Nordics  
* [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=Vi%20k%C3%B6per%2C%20s%C3%A4ljer%20och%20hyr,Och%20f%C3%B6r%20din%20budget)  
* ), Input (Nordic presence), Yllw/Soeco (have done projects in Denmark, and one case in Palma for a Swedish hotel chain, indicating international reach). Cross-border capabilities mean they can leverage inventory from Finland or Norway for a Swedish project (useful if domestic supply lacks something).

Price Positioning:

* Premium: High service, high quality, but also higher relative prices for reuse (maybe \~80–90% of new). These are typically offering like-new designer products with full warranties, justifying smaller discounts. *Examples:* Input/Greenified (if you’re buying a famous design classic refurbished, it might be 80% of new, but you get quality and service), Yllw Factory for some items (though generally \~50% of new, they might price rare design icons higher). Premium in reuse often also means including refurbishment and customization costs. These operators are chosen for quality-critical projects (e.g., luxury hotels needing pristine pieces but wanting to be circular).  
* Mid-Market: Balanced value (roughly 60–80% of new price). Most mainstream reuse deals fall here – significant savings but not rock-bottom. *Examples:* Rekomo (positions itself \~50% but many items can be 50–70%), RP (refurbished good furniture \~60% of new), Yllw (on average \~50–70% vs new after refurbishment costs  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=,vd%20och%20grundare%20av%20Soeco)  
* ), Kompanjonen (they might target mid-range pricing for items they broker – not premium, not scrap value). Mid-market operators try to ensure reused products are cost-effective yet sustainable (often appealing to mid-tier hotel budgets or public sector).  
* Value: Emphasis on low price (often 40–60% or less of new). These might have less refurbishment and possibly more “warehouse sale” vibe. *Examples:* Place2Place (some great deals if buying large lots), Brattöns (very cheap materials relative to buying new), Malmö depots (nominal prices), and auction or outlet sections of bigger players (Rekomo auctions or DPJ outlet items can go for very low prices). Quality may be more variable. Suitable for tight budgets or back-of-house needs, or when aesthetic can be compromised for cost.  
* Variable: Some operators don’t have a fixed pricing philosophy – it depends on the item condition and rarity. For instance, auction platforms (price determined by bids), or brokers like Kompanjonen (price depends on negotiating between seller and buyer). In these cases, a common scenario is if item is abundant, price is very low; if it’s a unique sought piece, price might be relatively high. Spirec also mixes free/cheap reclaimed items with some standard priced items.

Each operator’s offering can span these categories. For example, Yllw might offer both value options (simple refurbished task chairs at 40% of new) and premium options (fully customized design pieces at 80% of new). But this classification helps set expectations: Tier 1 “full-service” providers often charge a premium for the service and guarantee, whereas marketplace or salvage shops offer raw value deals but with more risk/effort required from the buyer.

## **C. Sourcing-kapabilitet (Sourcing Capability Deep-Dive)**

In this section, we evaluate how the most promising operators (roughly top 10-15 from above) would perform in three hypothetical hotel project sourcing scenarios. Each scenario tests different demands: fast boutique fit-out, large chain renovation, and luxury eclectic redesign. We assess each operator’s ability to meet the needs (Yes/No/Partially), identify what they can or cannot supply, lead time feasibility, and relative cost vs new.

### **Scenario 1: Fast-Track Boutique Hotel in Oslo – *45 rooms, 8-week timeline*.**

Needs: 45 matching wooden bed frames (mid-century style), 90 dining chairs (for restaurant/lounge, stylish), 45 desk chairs (ergonomic but design-conscious), plus lobby furniture (sofas, coffee tables, lounge chairs, decorative lighting). Aesthetic: Cohesive boutique design, mid-century modern vibe, high-quality finishes. Timeline: Only 8 weeks from order to on-site delivery in Oslo (cross-border from SE to NO). This scenario stresses speed and style coordination with moderate volume.

* YLLW Factory: Partially Yes. They have large stock and variety, so finding 45 mid-century style bed frames could be challenging but not impossible – they might have a stock of modern Scandinavian wood bed frames or could source and refurbish such frames. However, matching 45 identical vintage frames in 8 weeks is tough; they might instead offer to remanufacture 45 beds using reclaimed wood (“Pro2Type”) if the client accepts newly made from reclaimed materials  
* [yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=Image)  
* . For 90 dining chairs, Yllw likely can supply – they commonly have large sets of chairs from office canteens or conference centers, which can be reupholstered to match design (mid-century style fabric, etc.). 45 desk chairs (task chairs): easy – they have thousands of office chairs; to fit boutique aesthetic, they can re-cover them in stylish fabric. Lobby furniture: Yllw’s inventory includes design sofas, etc., and they can custom upholster in cohesive fabrics. Lead time: 8 weeks is tight but possibly realistic since much is in-stock. Yllw’s process includes refurbishing which can be scheduled; they noted being able to quote quickly due to their database  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Soeco%20har%20kontor%2C%20utst%C3%A4llning%20och,f%C3%A5r%20%C3%B6nskat%20utseende%20och%20funktion)  
* . They’d likely prioritize available items that need minimal work for speed. Shipping to Oslo adds a bit of time but feasible (they operate in Nordics). What can/can’t deliver: They can deliver all furniture categories required. If mid-century style is critical, truly vintage pieces might need more hunting; Yllw might instead simulate the style by mixing pieces from the 1960s they have or refinishing newer pieces to look retro. Cost vs new: Likely 50% or more savings. For example, refurbished designer chairs at \~1/3 new cost  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=,vd%20och%20grundare%20av%20Soeco)  
* . Overall, Yllw could probably meet \~80-100% of needs on time, with some creative solutions (so score: 4.5/5, “mostly yes”).  
* Rekomo: Partially. Relying on current stock, Rekomo may not have 45 identical bed frames because they focus on office furniture (beds are not typical office furniture). They might have some ex-hotel beds occasionally, but not guaranteed. They could potentially source from partners (e.g., if a hotel liquidation happens, but within 8 weeks that’s risky to plan). Dining chairs (90): quite possible – e.g., they might have a batch of 100 cafeteria chairs or stackable chairs in wood that could suit a trendy restaurant after minor tweaks. They have listed “café furniture” category  
* [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=ARBETSRUM)  
* . Style might be an issue: their inventory skews office functional. But if the boutique vibe can accept some modern corporate furniture, they have it. Desk chairs (45): easily – lots of ergonomic chairs in stock, though those might clash with boutique decor (black mesh chairs in a boutique hotel room?). They might propose alternative like sled-base guest chairs that look nicer, but then comfort suffers. Lobby furniture: Rekomo has sofas and lounge chairs (often corporate lobby style). Could supply items like nice used designer sofas (they sometimes get HAY or similar lounge pieces  
* [place2place.se](https://place2place.se/?srsltid=AfmBOor3Gqj0TYth_bLwfMb2ucUBdZmSoqjsfDxdTpGj5Uvwe4ukeTL7#:~:text=L%C3%A4gg%20i%20varukorg)  
* ). Lead time: Very quick – items are ready-stock. 8 weeks is fine for existing stock. Missing pieces: Bed frames are the biggest gap. Possibly also decorative lighting – Rekomo doesn’t list much in decorative lamps aside from some used office lamps. They might need to complement with new lighting. Cost vs new: Very favorable (their business model is half price or less). The client might need to compromise on design unity, since Rekomo’s stock is diverse. Perhaps a partial solution: get chairs and desks from Rekomo, but source beds elsewhere (new or from a hotel surplus specialist). Score: 3/5 (partial) – can cover seating and casegoods except beds, aesthetic coherence medium.  
* Input/Greenified: Yes (with caveats). Input’s network could likely source 45 bed frames – possibly from a hotel project (Input sometimes handles hotel refurbs, they might have connections to find used beds in storage). If not identical used beds available, they can suggest ex-showroom beds or prototype beds from manufacturers at discount – though those are technically new, it’s a circular approach if they use deadstock. Dining chairs (90): Input can pull from multiple office sites – e.g., maybe 3 different sets of 30 chairs each and then re-finish them uniformly. They also might have a client (like a closed restaurant) offering exactly 100 chairs. Their platform could locate such batches quickly across Sweden. Desk chairs: trivial – they have many. They could even rent these if project is short-term. Lobby furniture: Input can combine reused unique pieces for an eclectic yet cohesive look – e.g., they often have lightly used designer sofas (from corporate lounges) which in a boutique hotel would shine. Lead time: 8 weeks is challenging if items need refurb and cross-border delivery, but Input has scale. They might treat this as a project order, using both Greenified stock and new as backup. Because Input can fill any gap with new furniture to keep schedule (especially critical like beds). They could meet design by reupholstering pieces in matching fabrics (they have services for that  
* [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/tjanster/aterbruk/#:~:text=Renovera%20befintliga%20eller%20begagnade%20m%C3%B6bler,omtapetsering%20eller%20byte%20av%20delar)  
* ). Cost vs new: Likely around 60-70% of cost of buying entirely new, since some items might be sourced brand new if reused ones aren’t found in time (reducing savings). Still substantial CO₂ and cost savings on big items like chairs. Overall: They can meet all needs either through reuse or a hybrid solution; their ability to ensure cohesive design is high (with in-house designers). Score: 4/5 – basically yes, but might involve some new items or higher cost to expedite.  
* Recycling Partner (RP): Partial. RP’s forte is office, so beds are not in their usual inventory. They might have contacts (maybe they liquidated a small hotel or dorm before), but assuming not, they probably cannot supply 45 identical hotel-grade bed frames from stock. They could *manufacture or adapt* something (RP does carpentry repairs, but making 45 beds from scratch in 8 weeks is unlikely). Chairs (90 dining \+ 45 desk): yes, likely. They have many chairs and can refurbish to match style (paint, new upholstery). For a mid-century look, they might take a sturdy 90s wood chair frame and stain it walnut and re-cover in retro fabric – doable within 8 weeks if frames are in stock. Desk chairs: yes but style mismatch as with Rekomo; they might propose simpler upholstered chairs for the writing desks to fit boutique look. Lobby: They often have some sofas; can refurbish vintage finds (their “Remake” line could come into play to create bespoke lobby pieces from reclaimed materials  
* [cirkularasverige.se](https://cirkularasverige.se/aktorer/rp-kontorsinredning/#:~:text=M%C3%B6bler%20tv%C3%A4ttas%20och%20renoveras%20i,av%20n%C3%A5gon%20anledning%20anpassas)  
* ). Lead time: If items require significant refurbishing (e.g., reupholstering 90 chairs), 8 weeks is tight but perhaps manageable if they allocate enough workforce – they have upholstery capacity (Artex partnership) to scale up  
* [artex.se](https://www.artex.se/sv/referenser/hyfer-objects#:~:text=RP%20M%C3%96BLER%20OCH%20INREDNING%20,Vi%20renoverar%20m%C3%B6blerna)  
* . Transport to Oslo adds complexity (import duties, but manageable). Cost vs new: Very good – they pride on cost-effectiveness. Might be a bit higher than self-service options due to the refurb work (but still \~50% cheaper than new high-end boutique furniture). Missing: The bed frames likely need to be new or from another supplier. Score: 3/5 – can partially meet (all seating, tables, etc.) but beds are a gap, and style cohesion would rely on their customization capabilities.  
* Kompanjonen: Partial (or as coordinator). Kompanjonen itself wouldn’t “have” the items, but they can orchestrate sourcing from multiple places. For 45 bed frames – they might quickly reach out through their network (maybe knowing a large hotel that closed or an upcoming demolition of a student housing that had beds). 8 weeks is short for that approach, but not impossible if the timing is lucky. They can broker purchase from one source and transfer to the project. Chairs and other furniture: They can find 90 dining chairs via their network (e.g., knowing that a canteen in a company is closing). They could find desk chairs easily from an office clearance. Lobby items: Possibly search marketplace for retro pieces; or connect with antique dealers. Lead time: The risk is coordination time. 8 weeks might be consumed just arranging deals unless they have ready leads. They *excel at quick inventories* – if the hotel had existing furniture, they’d say “reuse what you have.” But in this scenario, it’s presumably all from external sources. Realistically, Kompanjonen might say: They can supply some items but not all within 8 weeks. They might recommend mixing new and reused to hit timeline (they’ll handle reused parts). Cost: Could be low for items found (maybe they negotiate good deals), but their consulting fee and multiple transport arrangements add overhead. Also, cross-border to Oslo might be an issue (they operate mainly in Sweden – but could collaborate with a Norwegian partner like Loopfront). Score: 2/5 – as a solo supplier, not ideal for urgent full fit-out; however as a *facilitator*, they could complement others.  
* Återbruksfabriken: No (for furniture). They deal with building materials mostly, not furniture, so beds/chairs are outside their scope. They could provide some interior materials if needed (e.g., reclaimed wood panels to build a bar, or reused lighting fixtures if any in stock). For the given needs, they wouldn’t be the go-to. They might partner with a furniture supplier to give a complete offering, but on their own: beds/chairs no, maybe some decorative or construction elements for lobby (like reclaimed flooring). Score: 1/5 for furniture needs; not applicable.  
* Brattöns Återbruk: No for uniform volume. They might have a few cool vintage chairs or some doors/timber for the boutique vibe, but assembling 45 identical of anything is unlikely. They could contribute accent pieces (like maybe 5 unique lobby chairs – eclectic, not matching though). And timeline to get to Oslo adds to impractical. Score: 1/5.  
* Place2Place: Partial. Place2Place’s catalog sometimes has large quantities: e.g., they had 68 matching Fritz Hansen dining chairs listed  
* [place2place.se](https://place2place.se/?srsltid=AfmBOor3Gqj0TYth_bLwfMb2ucUBdZmSoqjsfDxdTpGj5Uvwe4ukeTL7#:~:text=L%C3%A4gg%20i%20varukorg)  
* , which could cover the restaurant need nicely (if style fits). 45 desk/task chairs – they had 45 Humanscale lamps and presumably can source similar volumes of chairs  
* [place2place.se](https://place2place.se/?srsltid=AfmBOor3Gqj0TYth_bLwfMb2ucUBdZmSoqjsfDxdTpGj5Uvwe4ukeTL7#:~:text=L%C3%A4gg%20i%20varukorg)  
* . Bed frames are tricky – rarely appear on their site as it's mostly office/home furniture. Possibly they could locate some via their seller network (maybe 45 used IKEA or Fogia bed frames in one batch?). The aesthetic curation might be labor-intensive: their stock is mixed styles; to find mid-century style in volume might not coincide. Lead time: They can dispatch available items quickly (they operate like an e-commerce shipping out within days). So if the design team is flexible (e.g., chooses from what’s currently available on the site), it can meet 8 weeks easily. If specific style is a must, then they might not have time to source beyond current inventory. Cost: Good deals for what they have (some items new 30-40% of retail). They likely cannot guarantee things like fire treatment or reupholstery in that timeframe – items come as is. For a boutique project, an interior designer might need to reupholster after receiving them, which adds time/cost. Score: 2.5/5 – could fill some categories (dining chairs likely yes, others hit-or-miss) on time, but project would need flexibility.

Summary Scenario 1: The best bets are YLLW Factory and Input (Greenified) who can cover nearly all needs through a combination of stock and custom refurb, within 8 weeks, albeit possibly using a hybrid approach (some new items or expedited refurb)

[wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Soeco%20har%20kontor%2C%20utst%C3%A4llning%20och,f%C3%A5r%20%C3%B6nskat%20utseende%20och%20funktion)

[yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=Med%20%C3%B6ver%2065%20000%20%C3%A5terbrukade,och%20smart%20alternativ%20till%20nyproduktion)

. Rekomo and RP can cover seating and tables but not beds, so they’d need to be paired with another supplier for beds. Kompanjonen might serve as a useful partner to fill any specific gaps by brokering unique finds (e.g., sourcing genuine mid-century pieces to mix in for authenticity). A likely optimal solution: YLLW (for bulk furniture) \+ Kompanjonen or a vintage dealer (for a few signature pieces) \+ local new purchase for anything like mattresses or certified beds.

### **Scenario 2: Chain Hotel Renovation in Stockholm – *120 rooms, phased over 16 weeks*.**

Needs: 120 identical bed frames (queen size, durable), 240 nightstands (two per room, matching the beds), 120 TV benches/low dressers, 480 bath towels (matching, high quality), corridor textiles (e.g. carpet runners, artwork for walls). Aesthetic: Standardized chain-hotel look, not high luxury but consistent, fairly modern. Everything must be uniform across 120 rooms. Critical: All furniture must have fire certifications (or be treated) appropriate for hotel use (e.g., BS5852 or EN 13501 where applicable), and documentation should be provided. Timeline: 16 weeks total, delivery in phases to allow wing-by-wing renovation (e.g., deliver 60 rooms worth at week 8, then second 60 at week 16). This scenario emphasizes volume, uniformity, and compliance.

* YLLW Factory: Mostly Yes. While Yllw doesn’t normally stock hundreds of hotel beds, they can approach this in a few ways:  
  * Take-back from another hotel: If any large hotel is closing or rebranding, Yllw could procure 120 used bed frames. Not a common occurrence, but not impossible (could be from a chain’s refurb in another city).  
  * Refurbish office furniture into hotel use: For nightstands/TV benches, Yllw could repurpose storage units or tables from offices, refinishing them uniformly. They have carpentry capabilities to resize or add features.  
  * Manufacture using reclaimed materials: They could build simple nightstand frames from reclaimed wood (Pro2Type line) and perhaps reuse drawers from old cabinets. Given 16 weeks, some manufacturing is feasible, especially for something like nightstands that might not be found easily in identical quantity reused.  
    Bed frames: Possibly a mix approach: use existing bed bases (maybe ex-hospital or military barracks steel frames?) then clad in wood veneer for nicer look. They definitely can supply mattresses? (Usually not reused for hygiene; likely new or supplied by client). We focus on frames: likely metal or wood frames can be reused if structurally sound.  
    Towels (480): Textiles are tricky as second-hand due to hygiene. Yllw deals with furniture, not likely linens. They might skip towels entirely (hotel likely buys new towels). If circular, maybe renting towels from a linen service is an option (which is circular in a service sense). But no reuse supplier keeps large stocks of towels, especially with uniform color and hotel grade. This likely needs to be new or through hospitality linen leasing companies. So probably not delivered by Yllw.  
    Corridor textiles/art: Yllw could source carpets from office projects (carpet tiles or rugs) – but hotels need corridor carpet that meets fire code and heavy wear. Used carpet tiles could be an option (some companies sell barely used carpet squares). They could provide those if aesthetic matches (maybe a neutral pattern). Art/decor: They might have some decorative items, but corridors typically use new art or prints. Possibly Yllw could source second-hand framed prints from an office clearance.  
    Compliance: Yllw would ensure all furniture is either inherently compliant or treated. They can have upholstery fabric on headboards or chairs treated to Crib5 standard by working with fire treatment companies (they are aware of these requirements). They likely can provide EN 1021-1/2 test certificates for upholstery they do (using certified fabrics) and documentation for wood furniture if needed (e.g., that surfaces are fire lacquered or meet Euroclass D for wooden furniture, which is usually fine). Nightstands and TV benches typically not upholstered so just need to be sturdy and maybe meet general quality standards. BVD: If asked, they can provide material declaration, though for reused that often means noting it’s reclaimed wood etc.  
    Phased delivery: Absolutely, Yllw can coordinate storing items and delivering in two batches. They have capacity and trucks.  
    Volume capacity: They have done big office projects (e.g., supplied 30,000 chairs overall in stock  
  * [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Infl%C3%B6det%20%C3%A4r%20s%C3%A5%20stort%20att,i%20snitt%2C%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20annat)  
  * ). 120 bed sets is within their capacity if sourced. They might coordinate with a partner for some items (maybe work with a bed manufacturer to incorporate some reused components if needed).  
    Cost: Significant savings – bed frames and casegoods reused would be maybe 30–50% of new cost for a mid-range hotel furniture package.  
    Overall: Yllw could cover furniture pieces (beds, nightstands, TV units, maybe corridor furniture like console tables or mirrors), but linens (towels) they won’t supply. Score (excluding towels): 4/5 – strong for furniture, weak for textiles.  
* Rekomo: Partially.  
  Volume uniformity: Rekomo might have 120 of something like chairs or desks, but 120 identical bed frames is unlikely in their normal stock (again bed frames aren’t typical office furniture). They could try to source from a large dorm or so.  
  Nightstands/TV benches: They might propose repurposing office storage (e.g., small two-drawer pedestal units as nightstands). If they have 240 identical pedestals from a bank HQ, those could be painted and topped with a wood panel to look like nightstands. TV benches could be low office cabinets or credenzas – possible if they have a large batch from a conference center. The aesthetics might be utilitarian unless modified. Rekomo doesn’t do heavy carpentry, so modifications would be minimal.  
  Towels: Rekomo doesn’t deal in linens.  
  Corridor carpet/art: Not typically – they sell some rugs or acoustic panels but not large carpet rolls.  
  Phasing: They can store and deliver in batches, yes (they have warehouses).  
  Compliance: If items are originally office-grade, they are usually decent quality. But fire compliance: wooden furniture from offices isn’t typically fire rated (hotels require e.g. IMO for carpets or certain certification for upholstered seating in public areas). If any upholstery is involved (e.g., a padded headboard or chair in room), Rekomo’s items likely would need retroactive treatment or replacement. Rekomo likely cannot arrange fire treatment themselves; that’s outside their normal service. They also may not provide documentation proactively; a client would have to request and perhaps do extra testing.  
  Volume capacity: They can handle logistics for 120 rooms worth (their inventory size is big).  
  Cost: Very low compared to new hotel furniture (they might achieve the entire set for half or less of new price). But risk is that aesthetics and compliance might not fully satisfy chain standards, requiring additional work.  
  Score: 2.5/5 – can supply bulk furniture with modifications, but likely gaps in compliance (would need external help for fire certs) and cannot handle textiles.  
* Input/Greenified: Yes (almost entirely).  
  Input has advantage of possibly tapping into manufacturers’ overstocks for chain hotel uniformity. For example, they might find a discontinued line of hotel furniture (beds and nightstands) in storage and secure it. Or coordinate a take-back from a hotel chain’s renovation (since this scenario *is* a renovation, perhaps Input could manage the furniture being removed – if in good condition they could refurbish and reuse it in the same hotel or another property).  
  120 beds: Input often works with brands like Kinnarps who have hotel bed products; if a large client had surplus, Input can get those. They could also order new frames from a manufacturer and claim circularity by using reused materials elsewhere (though that’s bending the definition). However, because Input is a full-service provider, they might actually recommend mixing new and reused: e.g., reused headboards and nightstands from a closed hotel, combined with new bed bases for warranty.  
  Casegoods: likely yes – they can source uniform sets (maybe from an office with many similar cabinets, or from a cruise ship refit). If not matching out of the box, they can refinish them all identical. They have the resources to re-laminate or repaint furniture in large batches.  
  Towels: Not their domain, but they could connect the hotel to a textile circular service (like a company that recycles or leases textiles – recall the VarUnik example where a new service for hotel linens exists). Input might have that partnership, or at least incorporate it in the sustainability report. But physically, they wouldn’t supply used towels (hygiene and difficulty to source consistent quality).  
  Corridor: They can source used carpet tiles or remnant rolls; also lots of art gets liquidated from offices (framed prints, etc.), so they could curate each floor’s art from secondary market.  
  Phased execution: Input is used to phased office refits, so yes – they can store furniture and deliver wing by wing, and even help install (they have installation crews).  
  Compliance: Top-notch. They will ensure fire rating for textiles (could send any uncertified fabric to a lab for treatment or choose only certified fabrics in reupholstery). They can provide certificates or documentation (they know the standards and have in-house compliance experts for public tenders). For example, if the hotel needs proof that lounge chairs meet EN16139 (strength) and BS5852 (fire), Input can either supply chairs that originally had those certs or arrange testing for a sample. They might factor in an extra 2-4 weeks for testing one of each item at RISE (they have relationships to get that done if needed, at cost).  
  Volume & lead time: 120 rooms in 16 weeks is manageable. They likely would plan and start refurbishing immediately after contract sign, delivering first batch at 8 weeks easily.  
  Cost: Still significantly less than buying all new hotel furniture, but not dirt cheap: They provide high service, so maybe 60% of new cost. But for chain clients, the appeal might also be sustainability (which chains increasingly prioritize).  
  Score: 4.5/5 – basically yes, except they themselves wouldn’t do towels (they’d say go to a textile service), and possibly some small decor elements might be better new.  
* Recycling Partner (RP): Partial.  
  Beds & matching furniture: Not typical stock. RP might have done a project with a hotel liquidation, but unless they coincidentally have 120 beds, they’d have to source externally. They could coordinate with a liquidation auction – e.g., if a large hotel is selling furniture, RP could step in to buy the lot and refurbish them for this project. 16 weeks might allow that if such an opportunity arises early. If not, RP could manufacture simple items – they have carpentry: 240 identical nightstands could be built from scratch using reclaimed wood from their inventory of desks (e.g., cut-down desk tops as panels). This is plausible if design is simple, but it’s a lot of work for 240 pieces.  
  Uniformity: They can achieve uniform finishes via painting/upholstering.  
  Towels: No (they don’t supply linens).  
  Corridor textiles: Unlikely, aside from maybe second-hand signage or something trivial. Not really their field.  
  Phasing: They can deliver in phases, yes. They’d ensure first 60 rooms done, then second. They need to store the rest which they have space for.  
  Compliance: They might need guidance: They can refurbish furniture to like-new, but ensuring fire safety might require external help. They could partner with a fire treatment service (Artex might do fire-retardant fabric treatment if reupholstering chairs). Documentation may not be readily available unless they specifically test. Their sustainability report indicates focus on environment, but not sure on fire cert. Possibly they have not dealt with a stringent hospitality audit, so this is a gap – hence they'd be learning (Level 2-3).  
  Volume capacity: They have done whole offices, but 120 rooms of identical pieces is a challenge if they don’t find an existing batch. They could split source (e.g., get 60 beds of one model and 60 of another similar model – but that breaks uniformity). This scenario might overstretch them unless they collaborate with another vendor or the client is flexible on some new items.  
  Cost: Good savings if they pull it off, but some costs for custom building or treatment would add.  
  Score: 2.5/5 – significant capability on core furniture, but uniform beds and compliance are weak points.  
* Kompanjonen: As coordinator, potentially Yes (but not sole supplier).  
  Kompanjonen could shine in a *renovation project management* role: since it’s a chain-hotel renovation, they might already be involved in inventorying the old furniture. They could help reuse on-site: e.g., perhaps the existing bed frames can be kept and just modified, or among chain properties, shuffle furniture around. They could also source from multiple places: maybe 60 beds from one closed hotel \+ 60 from another. They have knowledge of demolition schedules (they often know in advance what buildings will be stripped)  
* [byggindustrin.se](https://www.byggindustrin.se/utveckling/hallbarhet/aterbruksexperter-om-marknadens-lycksokare-det-ar-rorigt-dar-ute-nu/#:~:text=%C3%85terbruksexperter%20om%20marknadens%20lycks%C3%B6kare%3A%20%E2%80%9DDet,i%20branschen%20kan%20leda)  
* , which could align to gather needed items. They would treat compliance seriously: might propose to test one reused bed frame for strength or get an engineer’s approval.  
  However, they wouldn’t themselves supply towels or textiles – they’d recommend using a sustainable textile vendor (maybe they know VarUnik’s new hotel linen service from industry news). Corridor carpets, they might suggest using a carpet tile from Interface’s reuse program, etc.  
  Phased: They can coordinate phases meticulously, ensuring minimal downtime. Possibly arrange temporary storage of removed items and bring them back cleaned (if reusing the hotel’s own furniture).  
  Realistically: Kompanjonen might not have physical capacity to deliver 120 sets on their own, but if integrated into the project team, they ensure all parties (furniture suppliers, contractors, etc.) work together to maximize reuse.  
  Score: If acting as project facilitator rather than a supplier: Yes for making it happen. If expected to directly furnish: No (they’d outsource the actual supply to others). So we’ll score in context: 4/5 as a facilitator, 1/5 as a stand-alone vendor.  
* Återbruksfabriken: Yes (for building materials aspect).  
  For the main furniture, no – that’s not their area. But for corridor refurbishment, they could supply reused building components: e.g., doors for 120 rooms (if the hotel wanted reclaimed solid wood doors to replace existing – they might find a batch of similar doors from an office demolition). Or ceiling tiles, light fixtures for corridors, etc. If the renovation includes building work (partition walls, etc.), they can contribute materials. They could also provide documentation for LEED/BREEAM on reused materials which chain hotels might need for certification.  
  But in furniture terms, they’d just complement others.  
  Score focusing on the main needs: 1/5 as furniture supplier, but note they could supply some materials.  
* Place2Place: No for large uniform batches.  
  Their marketplace might occasionally have a bulk lot (like those 68 chairs), but 120 identical beds or casegoods, very unlikely. Towel supply not relevant. They might provide a few items like if someone listed 100 identical side tables – but coordinating the whole package via a marketplace would be a logistics nightmare for the hotel. Possibly could source artwork cheaply (like someone selling 200 framed pictures from an office). But as a primary supplier, not suitable. Score: 1/5.

Summary Scenario 2: The best approach likely involves multiple collaborators:

* Input/Greenified or YLLW to provide the hard furniture (beds, nightstands, TV units) with assured compliance and uniform finish.  
* A textile service for towels (likely new or rental; reuse of towels is rare except perhaps if a closed hotel had barely used stock).  
* Kompanjonen or an internal sustainability manager to oversee reuse targets and documentation.  
  If single-operator: Input is the strongest candidate to cover most aspects and compliance. YLLW is strong on furniture but may need help on textile side.  
  Using Återbruksfabriken for any building material needs (doors, etc.) and Kompanjonen for strategy could yield a very high overall reuse content in the renovation.

### **Scenario 3: Luxury Resort Re-Design near Göteborg – *30 suites, flexible 20-week timeline*.**

Needs: High-end design furniture for suites and common areas, with a *mix-and-match boutique look*. Specifically, a range of unique statement pieces (vintage or designer) – e.g., iconic lounge chairs, art deco coffee tables, ornate mirrors – to give each suite a distinct character. Also, custom refurbishment and reupholstering is expected to tailor fabrics to the resort’s color scheme. Additionally, curated art & décor items for an eclectic, upscale ambiance. Timeline: 20 weeks (ample time for sourcing and customizing). Budget: Willing to pay premium for uniqueness; focus is more on sustainability and uniqueness than on cost-cutting, though still expect reused items to be cost-effective relative to equivalent new designer pieces. This scenario tests curatorial skill, access to rare items, and custom refurb quality.

* YLLW Factory: Yes (strong capabilities).  
  Yllw has a vast network and inventory including “classical design furniture in need of new upholstery or color”  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=I%20Soecos%20lokaler%20st%C3%A5r%20m%C3%A4ngder,l%C3%A4gre%20pris%20och%20l%C3%A4gre%20klimatp%C3%A5verkan)  
* . They specifically mention giving furniture “character and individuality” in new interiors  
* [alsbergstudio.se](https://alsbergstudio.se/repurposing-of-furniture/#:~:text=,interior%20with%20character%20and%20individuality)  
*  – aligning with this resort’s needs.  
  They can supply a base of high-quality vintage modern pieces (e.g., Arne Jacobsen chairs, Dux mid-century sofas, etc.) from their stock of famous brand furniture  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=dem%20klassiska%20designm%C3%B6bler%20i%20behov,l%C3%A4gre%20pris%20och%20l%C3%A4gre%20klimatp%C3%A5verkan)  
* . They then collaborate with skilled craftsmen to fully refurbish and even modify them to fit the resort’s style  
* [alsbergstudio.se](https://alsbergstudio.se/repurposing-of-furniture/#:~:text=potential%20for%20renovation)  
* . For example, they could reupholster chairs in luxury fabric (client’s choice), refinish wood in custom stains, combine parts (like mounting an old marble top on a reclaimed sideboard base to create a unique bar cabinet).  
  Yllw’s Pro2Type can create totally unique pieces from reclaimed materials – perfect for statement lobby installations or art furniture  
* [yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=Image)  
* .  
  They likely have a showroom where the resort designers can pick and choose from an array of items, then Yllw will “refresh” them per spec. They thrive in this creative process (as evidenced by case studies mixing second-hand in creative ways  
* [alsbergstudio.se](https://alsbergstudio.se/repurposing-of-furniture/#:~:text=Reusing%20existing%20interiors%20in%20combination,worked%20on%20over%20the%20years)  
* ).  
  Designer network: They might also directly purchase specific vintage pieces on the market on behalf of the client (like an auction for a 1960s designer lamp) and then include it in the package, since budget is there.  
  Curatorial ability: Yllw’s team includes interior designers (they do entire “inredningsarkitektur” projects  
* [alsbergstudio.se](https://alsbergstudio.se/repurposing-of-furniture/#:~:text=,10)  
* ). So they understand style coherence.  
  Custom refurb: Absolutely – they offer reupholstery, repainting, carpentry in-house or via partners  
* [alsbergstudio.se](https://alsbergstudio.se/repurposing-of-furniture/#:~:text=potential%20for%20renovation)  
* . They can even do custom sewing for cushions, etc. The time frame 20 weeks is comfortable for them to complete these bespoke tasks.  
  Art & decor: Possibly not their main inventory (they focus on furniture), but they could likely acquire decorative items. They could partner with local antique dealers or use their contacts (some reused furnishing companies team up with art curators; Yllw might as well, given high-end clients expect that).  
  Output quality: Should be “like-new” or intentionally patina where desired. With premium fabrics and finishes, these pieces will be contract-grade durable as well.  
  Price: The resort is willing to pay, and Yllw’s refurbished high-end items will still be cheaper than buying brand-new designer pieces. E.g., a refurbished Herman Miller Eames lounge might be 60% of new, even with new leather.  
  Score: 5/5 – Yllw can likely meet or exceed expectations, delivering unique sustainable luxury pieces.  
* Rekomo: No (not suited).  
  Rekomo deals in bulk and standard office fare, not one-off boutique treasures. Their inventory lacks “wow” pieces; it’s more functional. They also don’t do deep customization. They might have a few stylish items (maybe a Fritz Hansen sofa or an \&Tradition lamp as seen on their site  
* [place2place.se](https://place2place.se/?srsltid=AfmBOor3Gqj0TYth_bLwfMb2ucUBdZmSoqjsfDxdTpGj5Uvwe4ukeTL7#:~:text=Fritz%20Hansen%20Soffa%201%20st,186%20250%20kr%2Fst%20inkl%20moms)  
* ), but curation is not their business model. They can’t guarantee an eclectic luxury mix.  
  Score: 1/5 for this scenario.  
* Input/Greenified: Yes (via premium selection).  
  Input’s advantage is access to corporate art collections and high-end furniture from executive lounges. Greenified might list items like a Knoll Barcelona chair from a law firm or a Carl Hansen daybed from a CEO’s office. Input could gather those gems (they have contacts in many companies – sometimes they know when a company is discarding expensive designer furniture due to redesign).  
  They also can leverage manufacturers’ sample pieces: e.g., a luxury furniture brand might have some prototypes or ex-showroom pieces they’ll sell off – Input can grab those at discount (technically not used by a customer, but it’s circular in that it avoids new production).  
  Input’s design team can definitely curate an eclectic interior. They have done showpiece offices with \>50% reused items  
* [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/nyheter/aterbruk-i-praktiken-pa-kpmg/#:~:text=%C3%85terbruk%20i%20praktiken%20p%C3%A5%20KPMG,%C3%A5teranv%C3%A4nd%2C%20antingen%20direkt%20eller)  
*  – a similar concept to a boutique hotel suite.  
  They too can reupholster in client’s fabrics, refinish wood, and ensure each piece meets quality standards. For example, if the resort wants each suite to have a unique statement chair, Input could present 30 different iconic chairs from their network (Arne Jacobsen Egg, Fritz Hansen Wing, etc.), then have each refinished in the resort’s color palette. They have the procurement muscle to find these across Europe if needed (some might come from outside Sweden).  
  Art & decor: Input might collaborate with art consultants (they often furnish wall art in offices). They could source second-hand art (maybe via auctions or from hotels closing).  
  Timeline 20 weeks: Fine – allows time for hunting specific pieces and doing any needed restoration.  
  Cost: High but still likely 20-40% less than buying all pieces new from galleries/brands. They’ll charge for design services too.  
  Score: 5/5 – Input can deliver a curated luxury reuse package, given their broad network and design expertise.  
* Recycling Partner (RP): Maybe for some pieces (partial).  
  RP might have some interesting vintage furniture occasionally (they mention classic design pieces in their inventory sometimes). They have strong upholstery/carpentry skills to transform items in creative ways. If the resort team engaged them, RP could certainly produce some cool “upcycled” furniture – e.g., turning old industrial workbenches into chic coffee tables, or using old doors to create headboards with character. They even note combining “inredning som gått ur tiden” (outdated interiors) and adapting them  
* [cirkularasverige.se](https://cirkularasverige.se/aktorer/rp-kontorsinredning/#:~:text=M%C3%B6bler%20tv%C3%A4ttas%20och%20renoveras%20i,av%20n%C3%A5gon%20anledning%20anpassas)  
*  – which suggests creative repurposing.  
  However, they may not have a deep catalogue of iconic design objects ready to go. They could do more of a rustic/upcycled chic style than sourcing specific famous design pieces. If the resort’s luxury aesthetic leans towards *eclectic rustic* (like repurposed wood, bespoke handcrafted items), RP could do well. If it’s more mid-century modern luxe, they might not have enough range.  
  They likely would do well with custom requests: e.g., “We need a large statement conference table for a villa suite” – they could build one from reclaimed parquet flooring or similar. Their flexibility and 20 years experience would help.  
  Art & decor: Not their focus, though they might partner with others or source some decorative elements they come across in liquidations.  
  Score: 3/5 – capable of producing unique upcycled items and refurbishing design furniture if provided, but limited in sourcing truly rare pieces spontaneously.  
* Kompanjonen: As curator/advisor, potentially yes.  
  They know the second-hand market deeply, including auctions, vintage shops, etc. They could be hired as curators to find specific statement pieces the resort desires. For example, if the resort wants an authentic vintage Scandinavian sideboard in each suite, Kompanjonen could search across Sweden’s secondary market to find 30 high-quality ones, then coordinate their purchase and send them to a refurbisher (maybe Yllw or RP) for refinishing.  
  Kompanjonen’s value is connecting to niche suppliers: antique dealers, specialty niche reuse like Genbyg in Denmark for architectural salvage (could provide something like antique doors or lamps), or contacting artists who repurpose materials.  
  They likely relish a project like this because it’s about pushing reuse boundaries creatively.  
  However, as a single entity, they don’t deliver finished furniture – they’d assemble a coalition: e.g., find items, then use a partner to reupholster. With 20 weeks, they could manage that process.  
  Score: 4/5 as a facilitator of unique sourcing (particularly if paired with someone like Yllw or a skilled upholsterer to finish the pieces).  
* Återbruksfabriken: Possibly for decor elements.  
  A luxury resort redesign might incorporate reclaimed architectural elements (like an old oak beam installed as a mantle, or vintage floorboards for a rustic effect). Återbruksfabriken could supply such materials or even certain statement fixtures (an old cast iron bathtub, vintage doors). This adds authenticity. They wouldn’t do furniture, but their items can be part of the décor.  
  If the resort concept is “modern meets heritage”, using some reclaimed building materials from Återbruksfabriken can be a highlight (and they provide provenance stories).  
  They can meet custom requests given time: e.g., if asked for “antique wrought iron gates to use as headboard art”, they might locate some through their salvage network.  
  Score: not directly furnishing but valuable complementary. As an “operator” in this scenario, not scored since they don’t supply furniture.  
* Place2Place: Yes for finding specific pieces (with curation).  
  Their platform sometimes has high-end design items (like a Fritz Hansen sofa for 149k SEK  
* [place2place.se](https://place2place.se/?srsltid=AfmBOor3Gqj0TYth_bLwfMb2ucUBdZmSoqjsfDxdTpGj5Uvwe4ukeTL7#:~:text=L%C3%A4gg%20i%20varukorg)  
*  which indicates top-tier pieces show up). If resort designers browse it regularly, they could snag unique items – but one has to monitor listings. For 30 suites, Place2Place could yield a handful of gems (especially if budget is available to buy those listed design icons). They don’t curate for you, but an interior designer could treat it as a shopping source.  
  They can allow purchasing of disparate items easily. The downside: one must ensure condition is as advertised; also they won't unify the look – that’s up to the designer’s eye.  
  With 20 weeks, one could collect items steadily. They also cover art/lighting categories, so might find a fancy chandelier here, a sculpture there.  
  Custom refurb: Place2Place itself doesn’t refurbish, so either the item is used in current state or the hotel separately re-finishes it.  
  Score: 2.5/5 – a good resource for unique finds, but requires significant involvement from the project’s design team to assemble a cohesive collection.

Summary Scenario 3: This luxury, eclectic scenario leans heavily on specialized reuse players with creative capacity. YLLW Factory and Input/Greenified stand out for delivering curated, high-quality, fully refurbished pieces with design cohesion

[alsbergstudio.se](https://alsbergstudio.se/repurposing-of-furniture/#:~:text=,interior%20with%20character%20and%20individuality)

[wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=dem%20klassiska%20designm%C3%B6bler%20i%20behov,l%C3%A4gre%20pris%20och%20l%C3%A4gre%20klimatp%C3%A5verkan)

. Kompanjonen can serve as the “scout” for truly unique or hard-to-find items, collaborating with those full-service players. RP and smaller upcyclers can contribute one-of-a-kind furniture art pieces. Likely a combination: e.g., Input provides the core furniture set for each suite (some reused classics, fully redone), and Kompanjonen sources a few singular antiques or artwork per suite; Yllw or RP handle custom refurbishment of those sourced antiques if needed. The resort ends up with a rich mix where nearly everything has a story, delivered within 20 weeks due to careful planning and division of labor.

### **Coordinating Multiple Operators**

In scenarios where no single operator covers all needs, a multi-supplier strategy can be used. For instance:

* Scenario 1 (Boutique 45-room): A strong combination would be YLLW Factory for bulk furniture (beds, chairs) and Kompanjonen or a local vintage shop for unique lobby decor, plus possibly a Norwegian logistics partner for quick delivery to Oslo. This minimizes risk (Yllw handles majority with warranty, Kompanjonen adds character pieces). Coordination complexity: moderate – need to align design choices between Yllw and the boutique items.  
* Scenario 2 (Chain 120-room): A likely trio is Input/Greenified as primary (for all major furniture, compliance), Återbruksfabriken for any building materials (if walls, doors being reused), and a linen rental service for towels. Additionally, Yllw or RP could supply some items if Input needs extra volume. Coordination complexity: high – would require clear split (e.g., Input does furniture, builder works with Återbruksfabriken on materials). A general contractor or consultant (maybe Kompanjonen acting as project manager) can help orchestrate the timeline – ensuring reused items are ready when needed on site (just-in-time to avoid storage issues).  
* Scenario 3 (Luxury resort): A curated alliance: YLLW Factory \+ Kompanjonen \+ local antique dealers/artists. Perhaps Yllw is lead contractor supplying refurbished furniture sets, Kompanjonen sources specific antiques and an art curator sources art; all items then sent to Yllw’s facility for any touch-ups and delivered together. The resort’s interior designer would coordinate aesthetic vision among these parties. Complexity: high, but acceptable given timeline and project scale (30 suites). Framework agreements can be set: e.g., Yllw and Kompanjonen both contract with the client under a shared sustainability goal.

Managing multiple vendors: It raises the need for: clear responsibilities, integrated scheduling (so one vendor’s delay doesn’t stall the entire fit-out), and possibly a prime contractor (could be the design firm or a consultant) to manage communications. However, leveraging multiple specialists can ensure each need is met by an expert, increasing the overall success of reuse in the project. In conclusion, the sourcing deep-dive shows that no single operator is perfect for all scenarios, but Sweden’s reuse ecosystem collectively can cover nearly every need if used in combination. Large full-service hubs handle volume and logistics, while niche players contribute specialized items or knowledge (compliance, unique sourcing). For Fyra’s purposes, identifying the right mix of suppliers per project type will be key – this is explored further in recommendations (Section F and G).

## **D. Compliance & Regulatory Deep-Dive**

Ensuring regulatory compliance is critical in hospitality projects. Hotels must meet strict fire safety, building codes, and durability standards. Reused products add complexity because documentation may not be readily available or original certifications may not cover current use. This section examines how operators address compliance requirements and what processes exist in Sweden for testing and certification of reused furnishings and materials in hospitality contexts.

### **Fire Safety Compliance (Brannteknisk compliance)**

Furniture & Textile Fire Standards: In hotels, upholstered furniture and fabrics must resist ignition. Key standards include EN 1021-1 and 1021-2 (cigarette and match test for furniture), often required for hotel room chairs/sofas. For public area furniture, Crib 5 (BS 5852 Source 5\) or stricter may be needed, equivalent to European classification EN 13501-1 for building materials. Curtains and draperies often need at least B-s1,d0 rating under EN 13501-1 (low flammability, low smoke) or local Swedish standards (SIS fire tests).

* Many reuse operators acknowledge this need: e.g., YLLW/Soeco has likely provided fire-safe fabric on reupholstered pieces to meet hospitality fire codes (they work with contract-grade textiles  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=,vd%20och%20grundare%20av%20Soeco)  
* ). Input explicitly tests and certifies when reusing for clients who require it  
* [greenified.se](https://greenified.se/#:~:text=Greenified%20%E2%80%93%20En%20cirkul%C3%A4r%20m%C3%B6belmarknad,ett%20kostnadseffektivt%20och%20h%C3%A5llbart%20s%C3%A4tt)  
* .

Certificates: Ideally, reused items come with original fire certification (e.g., a chair that was originally contract-grade will have manufacturer’s certs). Rekomo and RP often carry brands like Kinnarps or Herman Miller which were originally tested to EN standards – these certificates can be obtained from the manufacturer or public databases. Operators like Input can likely provide those original certificates for known products. If items lack certification (e.g., vintage pieces or custom-upholstered items), operators may:

* Arrange fire testing: Some have relationships with labs (RISE/SP in Sweden, or RISE – Research Institutes of Sweden is mentioned in context  
* [byggindustrin.se](https://www.byggindustrin.se/utveckling/hallbarhet/aterbruksexperter-om-marknadens-lycksokare-det-ar-rorigt-dar-ute-nu/#:~:text=%C3%85terbruksexperter%20om%20marknadens%20lycks%C3%B6kare%3A%20%E2%80%9DDet,i%20branschen%20kan%20leda)  
* ). They can send a sample of the reupholstered material for crib tests. This usually takes 2-4 weeks and costs a few thousand SEK per test. Cost allocation: Typically this cost might be borne by the client if it’s a special request, or split. Some operators might absorb it if it’s necessary for the project (especially larger contracts).  
* Offer fire-retardant treatment: There are professional services to treat fabrics or wood with flame retardants to achieve required class. For example, textile treatment with flame retardant can upgrade an item to Crib 5\. Operators like Kompanjonen or Input likely have partner contacts for this (they’ve been asked these questions by clients; a Q\&A from Avropa.se hints that such issues are known in industry)  
* [avropa.se](https://www.avropa.se/ramavtal/ramavtalsomraden/mobler-och-inredning/cirkulara-mobelfloden/cirkulara-mobelfloden-avyttring-av-mobler/#:~:text=inte%20ta%20med%20m%C3%B6bler%20i,m%C3%B6bler%3F%E2%80%9D%20under%20%E2%80%9DFr%C3%A5gor%20och%20svar%E2%80%9D)  
* [avropa.se](https://www.avropa.se/ramavtal/ramavtalsomraden/mobler-och-inredning/cirkulara-mobelfloden/cirkulara-mobelfloden-avyttring-av-mobler/#:~:text=F%C3%B6r%20s%C3%A5dana%20m%C3%B6bler%20d%C3%A4r%20man,inom%20Flyttj%C3%A4nster%20vara%20mer%20f%C3%B6rdelaktigt)  
* .  
  * The effect on appearance/haptics is usually minimal for fabrics (some slight stiffness or discoloration possible, which is why testing a sample is wise). Wood treatments can slightly dull the finish. Operators would communicate that trade-off.

Who handles and pays? Many reuse suppliers would say: we can facilitate it, but at extra cost and time. For a large hospitality order, they may bundle it in the contract. For instance, YLLW with a 3-year warranty may include ensuring compliance as part of quality guarantee (they want it “no compromise”

[yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=Genom%20att%20k%C3%B6pa%20renoverad%20eller,v%C3%A4lja%20cirkul%C3%A4rt%20%E2%80%93%20utan%20kompromisser)

, which implies they’d ensure needed standards). Input likely adds a line item for any custom testing or treatment. Some, like RP or smaller ones, might rely on the client’s knowledge – if the client (Fyra/hotel) insists, they’ll comply but if not mentioned, they might skip it due to cost. Testing labs & process: In Sweden, RISE (formerly SP) is the main accredited lab for fire testing of furniture and materials. They can perform EN 1021 and BS 5852 tests fairly quickly. Some operators also use foreign labs (if faster or cheaper, e.g., UK or Danish labs). The typical timeline 2-4 weeks fits within project windows if planned early. It's recommended to test early (4+ months before use) to allow re-treatment or substitution if an item fails. Responsibility: Ideally, the reuse operator ensures compliance (especially Type A full-service ones). But for marketplace scenarios (Type D), the burden falls on the buyer. E.g., Place2Place simply sells items “as is” and disclaims such responsibilities; a hotel designer buying there must handle any necessary certification.

### **Building Material Compliance (Byggvarudeklarationer, BVD, etc.)**

BVD (Byggvarudeklaration): This is a Swedish building product declaration format that lists material contents, chemicals, etc., often used for green building rating or just to inform. For new building products, manufacturers provide BVD or similar Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). For reused items, sometimes an “BVD Reuse” can be created stating the item is reused and referencing original materials if known.

* Operators providing BVD: Likely Återbruksfabriken and Kompanjonen being involved in CCBuild and green construction, can provide documentation. Återbruksfabriken explicitly mentions giving documentation to clients for environmental reporting  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=Tj%C3%A4nster)  
* . This presumably includes material descriptions and possibly an EPD credit for reused vs new (they list CO2 savings on items

* ).  
* Spirec and others might not have formal BVDs for each item (being a young startup), but as the market matures, more are using CCBuild’s standardized templates.

Chemical compliance (REACH, SVHC): Hotels and public buildings require assurance that furniture does not contain banned substances (like certain flame retardants, heavy metals, etc.). Reuse can be tricky because older items might have chemicals not allowed today. E.g., foam in chairs from 1990s might have PBDE flame retardants now banned. Operators’ approach:

* Intake screening: Reuse operators often avoid very old items that likely have harmful chemicals (like they might not accept 1980s foam seating because of this). Kompanjonen has noted lack of chemical content info as a barrier  
* [diva-portal.org](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1549635/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=subventioner%20bed%C3%B6ms%20dock%20som%20n%C3%B6dv%C3%A4ndiga,hos%20ink%C3%B6psorganisationer%20d%C3%A4r%20v%C3%A4rderingen%20av)  
* . Some use x-ray fluorescence (XRF) guns or rely on manufacturer info to check for things like brominated flame retardants.  
* Documentation: If they know the brand/model, they might obtain the materials list. Greenified by Input could supply original product environmental data if it exists.  
* If an item likely has hazardous content, reputable operators will not reuse it in sensitive environments. E.g., ceiling tiles with asbestos obviously discarded, or old PVC flooring with banned phthalates – not offered for reuse unless tested safe.  
* Kompanjonen and CCBuild encourage using a “logbook” approach to track materials in reuse  
* [diva-portal.org](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1549635/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=f%C3%B6r%20f%C3%B6rbr%C3%A4nning,Det)  
* .

VOC emissions: Hotels care about indoor air quality. Reused furniture typically has low VOC (any offgassing happened long ago), which is actually an advantage. But if pieces are refurbished (fresh paint, new foam), operators should use low-VOC finishes and certify that. Many reuse operators lean “eco” so they likely use water-based lacquers, OEKO-Tex textiles, etc. They can provide info on that on request. Allergens: For textiles (rugs, curtains), a concern is allergens or past contamination (mold, etc.). Reuse suppliers mitigate by professional cleaning and sometimes antimicrobial treatments. Few have formal allergen info, but they can declare if a used textile is wool (some people allergic) or if they applied any anti-dust-mite treatment.

### **Durability & Safety Standards for Hotel Furniture**

Hotels need contract-grade furniture:

* Chairs: EN 16139 for strength and durability (Level 1 or 2 depending on use area) is often required.  
* Tables: EN 1730 (stability, fatigue).  
* Beds: No single EN standard, but generally they should be robust for 24/7 use.  
* Reused contract furniture often already complies if originally made for commercial use. E.g., an ex-office chair usually meets EN 1335 or ANSI/BIFMA standards, which are acceptable.  
* The challenge is with residential-grade reused items making their way into hotels. E.g., a vintage home sofa might not withstand high usage. Thus:  
  * Top operators select only high-quality pieces (Soeco’s philosophy of using high-quality frames  
  * [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=dem%20klassiska%20designm%C3%B6bler%20i%20behov,l%C3%A4gre%20pris%20och%20l%C3%A4gre%20klimatp%C3%A5verkan)  
  * ).  
  * They may do reinforcement during refurbishment (tighten joints, add brackets).  
  * Some might send a sample chair to a test lab for strength testing if it’s a big order of reused chairs.

Contract vs residential grade: Many operators mention they focus on high-quality brands (which often are contract grade even if used in offices). But if an operator offers a stylish older piece, one must consider if it was built for heavy use. Often, mid-century furniture was very well-built, but an operator like YLLW or RP might replace internal components (springs, support) to essentially bring it to modern contract robustness. They often give warranty (YLLW 3 years

[yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=Vi%20renoverar%20och%20anpassar%20b%C3%A5de,l%C3%A4mnar%20minst%203%20%C3%A5rs%20garanti)

, RP 3 years

[rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=,49)

) which indicates confidence in durability after their refurbishment. Maintenance & cleaning: Hotels require easily cleanable furnishings:

* Reused upholstery: Operators typically reupholster in contract fabrics which have high rub count and sometimes stain protection. Some even offer anti-microbial or easy-clean coatings on request (especially post-Covid, some offices asked for that too).  
* They provide cleaning instructions with the product info. E.g., if they supply second-hand armchairs, they’ll include info like “fabric is Trevira CS, washable at 60°C” or “leather – wipe with damp cloth”.  
* Casegoods: If they repaint furniture, they’ll use durable lacquer (possibly even marine-grade for high wear).  
* One could request an extra set of replaceable covers for reused chairs if they expect heavy wear; an operator like YLLW could sew spare covers from matching fabric as part of contract, given they handle upholstery.

### **Compliance Documentation Readiness**

We evaluate how prepared each operator is to deliver a “compliance packet” for hospitality projects:

* YLLW Factory: Ready (🟢) – They operate at a high professional level. While Soeco’s focus was offices, being a framework supplier to public entities means they’re used to providing documentation. They likely have a system for product descriptions with materials, certificates for any new fabrics used, and so on. Fire certs and test reports might be “Kan ordnas” (🟡) – if not already on file, they will arrange/obtain them on request. Given their stance of no compromise quality  
* [yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=Genom%20att%20k%C3%B6pa%20renoverad%20eller,v%C3%A4lja%20cirkul%C3%A4rt%20%E2%80%93%20utan%20kompromisser)  
* , they would treat compliance seriously, even if it means extra steps.  
* Input/Greenified: Very Ready (🟢) – Input has a compliance team. They can produce fire certificates, EN test references, material declarations, likely even EPD data for reused content (they participated in projects calculating 195 ton CO2 savings  
* [eon.se](https://www.eon.se/content/dam/eon-se/swe-documents/swe-sammanfattning-analys-kontorsflytt-2023.pdf#:~:text=,akt%C3%B6rer%20inte%20ska%20fokusera%20p%C3%A5)  
* , implying they do custom sustainability reporting). They probably have templates ready to fill for each reused item (detailing original manufacturer, year, etc., which covers provenance and potentially previous use context).  
* Rekomo: Moderate (🟡) – They have ISO certifications and work with many municipalities (they display Kammarkollegiet contract symbol  
* [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=Image%3A%20iso%20certificate%20%20,162)  
* , suggesting they are an approved supplier perhaps). So they likely can provide basic info (brand, model of furniture, maybe flame resistance if known). But they don’t routinely supply hotels, so things like a full BVB or REACH statement might not be at hand unless asked. They might scramble a bit if a client asks for, say, an EPD for each reused desk. They can give qualitative info (“used item, already amortized environmental footprint”) but less formal documentation.  
* RP: Moderate (🟡) – They have a sustainability report and clearly advertise their policies  
* [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=,49)  
* [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=P%C3%A5%20RP%20erbjuder%20vi%20mer,b%C3%A5de%20milj%C3%B6v%C3%A4nlig%20och%20ekonomiskt%20f%C3%B6rdelaktig)  
* . For compliance, they likely provide warranty docs (3-year functional guarantee), and any requested test info they have. Fire certification would be new to them for hospitality – they’d need to partner up for that (so they can but haven’t done it frequently – call that 🟡 can be arranged).  
* Kompanjonen: High for consulting (🟢) – They can compile detailed documentation because their value to corporate clients is partly in reporting. They can produce a “reuse report” with all items, their origin, age, and any known compliance info. They know where to get missing pieces (lab tests, etc.). They did mention compliance is often a perceived barrier and they work to solve it  
* [byggindustrin.se](https://www.byggindustrin.se/utveckling/hallbarhet/aterbruksexperter-om-marknadens-lycksokare-det-ar-rorigt-dar-ute-nu/#:~:text=%C3%85terbruksexperter%20om%20marknadens%20lycks%C3%B6kare%3A%20%E2%80%9DDet,i%20branschen%20kan%20leda)  
* . Not being a manufacturer, they won’t have ready-made certs, but they will ensure they are obtained.  
* Återbruksfabriken: Ready (🟢) – For building materials, they absolutely provide documentation. They likely have BVDs for each product entry or at least a statement of material type and condition. They also provide CO2 savings data  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=1%20st%20Rund%20metallkanal%2C%20gr%C3%A5%2C,kg%20CO2%20Se%20alla%20produkter)  
*  and likely any lab results if they test structural components. They aim to support future building code compliance with reused materials  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=P%C3%A5%20kort%20sikt%20fokuserar%20vi,att%20g%C3%A5%20direkt%20till%20deponi)  
* , so documentation is part of their service.  
* Others (Place2Place, etc.): Minimal (🔴) – They operate more like classifieds, so they provide item description but not formal compliance docs. The burden is on buyer to vet.

Preparation time: For well-prepared operators (Input, YLLW), they could assemble the needed documentation within a couple of weeks, since they have much info in databases (YLLW’s database tracks condition and presumably product details

[wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Soeco%20har%20kontor%2C%20utst%C3%A4llning%20och,f%C3%A5r%20%C3%B6nskat%20utseende%20och%20funktion)

). For others, it might take longer and some pushing. E.g., a smaller supplier might need 4-6 weeks to get a fire test done and to gather all tech specs. Extra costs: Expect additional fees for:

* Fire testing or treatment (often a few thousand SEK per item type).  
* Structural engineering approvals for reused materials if needed.  
* Extended warranties or certifications beyond standard. Some operators might treat it as part of big project overhead, others will line-item it.

Summary: Ensuring reused items meet hospitality codes is definitely doable in Sweden’s context, but it requires early planning (test and treat well in advance of installation) and often close collaboration between the design team and the reuse supplier. The top-tier operators are increasingly aware of these needs and either have internal solutions or partner networks to address them. Hotels aiming for green building certifications will also require data on reused content (like % reused vs new, carbon savings) – many operators can provide those metrics now (e.g., CCBuild marketplace accumulative data, YLLW citing saved emissions

[yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=65000)

). So with the right operators, compliance and documentation, while a challenge, can be managed so that reused furnishings are delivered “up to code” and with clear provenance and environmental impact data.

## **E. Markedsanalyse – Svensk gjenbrukslandskap (Market Analysis of the Swedish Reuse Landscape)**

This section provides a broader market analysis of the B2B reuse industry in Sweden, especially as it relates to furniture and building materials supply for projects. We look at market size, structure, key segments, value chain, trends, and a brief comparison with Finland’s reuse market.

### **Market Size & Structure**

The Swedish B2B reuse market for furniture and interiors is growing but still emerging towards maturity:

* Number of operators: Estimated on the order of dozens of significant B2B-focused reuse operators. A rough breakdown:  
  * Perhaps 5–10 larger companies dominate office furniture reuse (e.g., Rekomo, YLLW, RP, Input/Greenified, DPJ’s used division).  
  * Another 5–10 specialized players in building materials reuse (Återbruksfabriken, Kompanjonen, Brattöns, Spirec, etc.).  
  * Several digital platforms (CCBuild, Loopfront, etc.) acting as aggregators.  
  * Then many smaller local stores or non-profits that occasionally do B2B but primarily handle consumer or small-scale reuse (e.g., municipal second-hand depots, social enterprises like “Återbruket” in various towns).

Market concentration: It’s relatively fragmented but with a few front-runners:

* Office furniture reuse has a couple of big players (Rekomo, YLLW) that operate across regions, implying moderate concentration in that sub-segment.  
* Building material reuse is currently fragmented regionally (e.g., one hub in Stockholm, one in Gothenburg, etc.) – but efforts like CCBuild aim to connect them, not necessarily consolidate but at least network them.  
* There is little direct competition yet in hospitality reuse specifically – whoever has done hotels likely did so as one-off or from office segment pivot. So no single company monopolizes “hotel reuse supply”.

Geographical distribution:

* Stockholm – a hotbed for reuse startups and initiatives (because largest market of offices and construction). Kompanjonen, Input’s HQ, and the “Återbrukshubben” pilot in Solna suggest concentration. The city also pushes circular economy in procurement.  
* Gothenburg – also active: e.g., Brattöns, Rekomo has large presence, and likely some circular projects via Chalmers and Riksbyggen. West Sweden has heavy industry that might feed materials into reuse.  
* Skåne (Malmö/Lund) – very engaged in sustainability: Malmö has had Återbyggdepå for \~20 years  
* [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/smalmo/videos/andreas-sch%C3%B6nstr%C3%B6m-s-ber%C3%A4ttar-om-malm%C3%B6-%C3%A5terbyggdep%C3%A5/220902238979850/#:~:text=Andreas%20Sch%C3%B6nstr%C3%B6m%20,sedan%2020%20%C3%A5r%20Malm%C3%B6)  
* , Wihlborgs (a big real estate firm in Malmö) embraced reuse with Soeco/YLLW  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=P%C3%A5%20Soeco%20f%C3%A5r%20gamla%20Andy,%C3%A5terbruk%20med%20fokus%20p%C3%A5%20kontorsinredning)  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Ramavtalet%20som%20Wihlborgs%20har%20med,avkall%20p%C3%A5%20funktion%20eller%20design)  
* . YLLW (Soeco) itself is based there. So Skåne has both private and public emphasis on reuse.  
* Northern Sweden: Less representation. Possibly because fewer large offices to generate supply and less local demand. Some initiatives might exist (like recycling centers repurposing building parts, but low commercial scale yet). So the market is mostly south-central Sweden.

Growth rate: The market is growing quickly:

* Many companies (like Soeco/YLLW) reported \~30% annual growth  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Infl%C3%B6det%20%C3%A4r%20s%C3%A5%20stort%20att,i%20snitt%2C%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20annat)  
* .  
* New entrants like Återbruksfabriken (2021), Spirec (2022) show increase in venture activity.  
* The government and big firms (Folksam, Vasakronan, etc.) are supporting reuse pilots, indicating expansion.  
* Perhaps 2-3 significant new entrants per year in various niches (some may stay small, others scaling).

### **Segment Analysis by Product Category**

Furniture (office/hospitality furniture):

* Maturity: Among reuse segments, furniture is relatively mature in Sweden. Office furniture reuse has been around for decades (e.g., Vican since 1989, Rekomo \~30 years). This segment benefitted early from cost savings drivers and abundant supply from office churn.  
* Competitive intensity: Medium but increasing – traditional dealers now have to consider circular offerings (like Input did with Greenified, DPJ started used section), showing competition. Still, not all mainstream have caught up, so players like Rekomo grew in the absence of too many competitors, but now with YLLW’s rise and others, competition intensifies.  
* Best players: YLLW/Soeco, Rekomo, RP, Input/Greenified – these lead in volume and capability. Niche quality player includes VarUnik (if focusing on hotels, though that’s more service model).  
* Gaps: Perhaps less coverage on residential furniture in B2B context, but that’s outside our scope. For hospitality, a gap might be an operator specializing exclusively in hotel furniture reuse (one that handles decorative and casegoods systematically) – currently not clearly present; office-focused players adapt to it.

Textiles:

* Maturity: This is an emerging sub-segment. Historically, second-hand textiles in B2B were rare due to laundry/hygiene and certification (flame retardancy) issues. But now:  
  * Efforts like VarUnik’s hotel textile subscription (just launched in 2022\) show innovation – presumably they provide linens made of recycled fibers or circulate linens between hotels as a service  
  * [ca.se](https://ca.se/category/b2b/#:~:text=Ny%20cirkul%C3%A4r%20abonnemangstj%C3%A4nst%20f%C3%B6r%20hotell)  
  * .  
  * Siptex – an automated textile sorting facility by Sysav (Skåne)  
  * [ca.se](https://ca.se/category/b2b/#:~:text=Siptex%20vinnare%20av%20Stockholm%20Fashion,Districts%20h%C3%A5llbarhetspris%20Encouragement%20for%20Action)  
  *  is an upstream enabler (sorts textiles for recycling but also possibly identification for reuse).  
* Niche players: not many specifically for reused textiles. Matting AB maybe does reuse of carpet tiles?  
* Gaps: Hotels need FR-rated curtains, etc. There might be companies reconditioning theater curtains or similar, but it’s niche. It's likely an area for growth – e.g., a service to clean and certify used hotel curtains could develop.

Building Materials:

* Maturity: Still early but rapidly developing. The construction sector only recently embraced reuse at scale. Initiatives like CCBuild (coordinated by IVL) indicate a push towards industrial scale reuse  
* [ivl.se](https://www.ivl.se/vart-erbjudande/forskning/cirkulara-floden/cirkulara-produktfloden-i-byggsektorn.html#:~:text=Centrum%20f%C3%B6r%20cirkul%C3%A4rt%20byggande%20,p%C3%A5%20systemniv%C3%A5%20mot%20cirkul%C3%A4ra)  
* .  
* Key players: Kompanjonen (10 years in building material reuse  
* [diva-portal.org](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1549635/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=3,att%20koppla%20ihop%20tillg%C3%A5ng%20och)  
* , an early mover), Brattöns (over 10 years, essentially a salvage yard veteran  
* [kommunochnaringsliv.se](https://kommunochnaringsliv.se/redan-en-veteran-inom-aterbruk/#:~:text=N%C3%A4ringsliv%20kommunochnaringsliv,F%C3%B6retaget%20demonterar%20byggmaterial%20som)  
* ), Malmö Återbyggdepå (a long-running depot), Wiklunds (a demolition/logistics firm pivoting to reuse partner  
* [wiklunds.se](https://www.wiklunds.se/affarsomraden/cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=Wiklunds%20kan%20vara%20byggherrens%20samarbetspartner,%C3%A4r%20att%20skapa%20goda)  
* ), Ragn-Sells (big waste co, piloting reuse with others  
* [shiftsweden.se](https://www.shiftsweden.se/Media/sg2bfjo0/utvecklad-marknad-och-logistik-for-aterbruk.pdf#:~:text=ShiftSweden%20www.shiftsweden.se%20%20Ragn,Lindholmen%20Science%20Park%2C%20Lunds)  
* ).  
* Emerging segment: yes, many pilots – e.g., large developers like Fabege setting up reuse warehouses on their dev sites  
* [svenskttra.se](https://www.svenskttra.se/om-oss/aktuellt/2024/2/vilka-ar-de-storsta-utmaningarna-med-att-aterbruka-byggmaterial/#:~:text=Vilka%20%C3%A4r%20de%20st%C3%B6rsta%20utmaningarna,har%20man%20nu%20%C3%B6ppnat%20%C3%85terbrukshubben)  
* .  
* Key players: Also mention of “Återbrukshubben” by Fabege, and “Loop Rocks” by NCC (for rubble etc.).  
* Challenges: Regulatory barriers (product liability for structural items, lack of standards), logistical costs for heavy materials, and matching supply-demand timing.  
* But momentum is strong due to climate goals. Likely significant growth in next 5 years as new building regulations might mandate reuse consideration.

Lighting:

* Maturity: Moderate. Office lighting (ceiling fixtures, task lamps) often gets reused moderately (Rekomo, etc., do sell some used lamps). Some specialist may exist: e.g., LightReuse (not sure if an actual company, hypothetical).  
* Challenges: Rapid tech change (LED efficiency improving means older fixtures may be less desired; also connected/smart lighting preferences). But high-end decorative lighting can be very worthwhile to reuse (vintage designer lamps are valued).  
* Players: No dedicated ones identified, but general furniture resellers handle some. Also, demolition sales often include large lots of light fixtures (Kompanjonen and CCBuild have these listings).  
* Gaps: Possibly a business opportunity for a lighting-specific refurbisher (e.g., rewiring and certifying used lamps for new projects).  
* For hospitality, a lot of hotels toss lamps during reno – few systematically reuse them. A notable gap: an operator offering refurbished hotel guestroom lamps with new wiring and shades to meet standards could find market, but currently hotels likely buy new due to code concerns.

Dedicated Hotel Reuse Operators:

* There aren’t many dedicated hospitality reuse suppliers yet. VarUnik’s new service is one example focusing on hotel textiles. We haven’t seen “Hotel surplus outlet AB” – but in other countries (like the US) companies buy bulk furniture from hotels and resell to smaller hotels or B2C. In Sweden, this might happen ad-hoc (auction houses handling hotel liquidations, e.g., PS Auction sometimes sells entire hotel contents).  
* It seems Sweden does not yet have a big company that markets specifically to hotels for reused FF\&E (Furniture, Fixtures & Equipment). This is likely because historically hotels prefer brand new for image reasons, but that is now changing with sustainability trends. So we might foresee one of the office reuse companies launching a “hospitality division” soon.

### **Value Chain Mapping**

Understanding the flow of goods in the reuse ecosystem: Supply sources (input of used items):

* Office closures and corporate refurbishments – major source of quality furniture (desks, chairs, cabinets). E.g., when a bank redecorates, hundreds of items enter the reuse stream (via auctions or companies like Kompanjonen, Rekomo).  
* Hotel renovations/closures – potentially large source of furniture, carpets, light fixtures, even bathroom fixtures. Historically, much was scrapped or sold overseas. Now, if harnessed, it’s a goldmine for reuse: e.g., 300 hotel rooms worth of furniture can supply multiple smaller projects. However, currently, specialized handling is lacking (some furniture might go to staff or local auctions).  
* Public sector – municipalities and government agencies often have surplus furniture (schools, hospitals etc.), which feed into reuse operators or auction sites. Also, old building materials from public demolitions can be funneled (some municipalities have internal reuse hubs).  
* Demolition contractors – key players like Rivners, Skanska etc. If they partner with reuse hubs, valuable materials (doors, raised floors, HVAC equipment) can be rescued instead of scrapped. E.g., Wiklunds (a demolition/logistics firm) now offers to salvage and store materials for reuse  
* [wiklunds.se](https://www.wiklunds.se/affarsomraden/cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=Wiklunds%20kan%20vara%20byggherrens%20samarbetspartner,%C3%A4r%20att%20skapa%20goda)  
* .  
* Manufacturers’ surplus – sometimes new products that are overstock, returns, or out-of-production stock enter the reuse market. E.g., Spirec buying unused trim boards that were mis-ordered  
* [spirec.se](https://spirec.se/pages/om-spirec?srsltid=AfmBOoqLO7_aAICcobHJfkiy90CEch2sYI1sSnIdrfic389VPTe1cPfM#:~:text=Det%20kan%20%C3%A4ven%20vara%20helt,formvirke%20som%20anv%C3%A4nts%20vid%20gjutning)  
* . Also, furniture makers may resell returned items via second-hand partners.  
* Bankruptcy liquidations – unfortunately a source: failed businesses (restaurants, stores) whose contents get sold off (often via auction, but sometimes reuse companies step in).  
* Consumers? – Generally, B2B channels don’t rely on individual consumers’ used goods (except maybe antiques or unique pieces from estates that could be repurposed in commercial projects by designers).

Processing / refurbishment:

* Refurbishment workshops – either in-house (Yllw’s big factory  
* [tema.storynews.se](https://tema.storynews.se/soeco/#:~:text=Agendadrivna%20%C3%A5terbruksf%C3%B6retaget%20Soeco%20s%C3%A4ljer%20begagnade,att%20g%C3%B6ra%20avkall%20p%C3%A5)  
* , RP’s “möbelrekond”) or subcontracted (e.g., Artex does upholstery for many reuse firms  
* [artex.se](https://www.artex.se/sv/referenser/hyfer-objects#:~:text=RP%20M%C3%96BLER%20OCH%20INREDNING%20,Vi%20renoverar%20m%C3%B6blerna)  
* ). They clean, repair, reupholster, refinish. This stage adds value by ensuring items are project-ready, safe, and aesthetically suitable.  
* Testing labs – part of processing if needed for compliance (e.g., RISE doing fire tests, as mentioned). Not continuous flow, but an important supporting actor.  
* Cleaning and certification – for materials like wood beams, maybe structural engineers check them. For textiles, industrial laundries (if someone reused acoustic ceiling panels, for instance, they'd need cleaning).  
* Customization – some players do modifications (cutting to size, painting a uniform color scheme). There are carpentry shops specialized in adjusting standard modules (e.g., cutting down a large table to smaller ones).

Distribution:

* Logistics specialists – Large furniture reuse needs big transport and often assembly. Some reuse firms have their own trucks, others use logistics companies experienced in handling bulky items (like MTAB for fine art and furniture, or regular freight).  
* Warehousing – Storage in between is crucial, especially to accumulate enough identical items or to hold them until a project needs them (the “inventory waiting for use” time). Big players have warehouses (5000 m² for Återbruksfabriken

* , etc.). There are also external warehouse providers that might partner to store reclaimed materials near cities.  
* Digital platforms – Part of distribution nowadays: they list what’s available and connect distant supply & demand. CCBuild’s marketplace, Blocket (Swedish classifieds) which sometimes used by businesses, and specialized auctions (e.g., PS Auction, Klaravik) play a role in transacting used business inventory.

### **Ecosystem and Infrastructure**

Enabling Infrastructure:

* Testing Labs: RISE is central. Also Swedish Technical Research Institute if separate, and possibly others (universities doing tests as part of research projects).  
* Refurbishment Services: Besides the reuse companies themselves, there are independent ones: e.g., Artex AB (mentioned in search as a partner to RP  
* [artex.se](https://www.artex.se/sv/referenser/hyfer-objects#:~:text=RP%20M%C3%96BLER%20OCH%20INREDNING%20,Vi%20renoverar%20m%C3%B6blerna)  
* ) focuses on reupholstering and renovating furniture. Tapetserarverkstäder (traditional upholstery studios) also sometimes collaborate on high-end projects. Carpentry shops that take on re-finishing wood furniture. These service providers are crucial to scale quality refurbishment.  
* Logistics Specialists: Companies like Wiklunds pivoting to reuse means they provide both removal and delivery services. Also standard freight companies adapt to handling not just palletized new goods but odd used items (some differences in packing).  
* Inventory Management Systems: CCBuild provides an online platform for tracking an organization’s reusable assets (like a database so companies can post internally first). Some large property owners build their own reuse inventory systems for their portfolio, then link with external marketplaces.  
* Marketplaces: Apart from CCBuild, there's Byggnetto or Byggigen (older marketplace for building goods), and broad ones like Blocket or Facebook Marketplace (not specialized, but definitely used by small businesses to sell furniture).

Policy & Support:

* The Swedish government and agencies are pushing circular economy:  
  * Public procurement guidelines now encourage reuse. There are framework agreements e.g., “Cirkulära Möbelflöden” (circular furniture flows) by Kammarkollegiet  
  * [avropa.se](https://www.avropa.se/Nyheter/2025/forvaltningen/soeco-kontorsmobler-ab-namnandrar/#:~:text=Publicerad%202025)  
  * . So agencies can call off reuse services from approved vendors (Soeco/YLLW was one such vendor).  
  * Subsidies/Grants: Vinnova (Sweden’s innovation agency) has funded circular business model research and pilots  
  * [diva-portal.org](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1446500/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=,och%20utveckling%20av%20effektiva%20innovationssystem)  
  * . Naturvårdsverket (Environmental agency) as well  
  * [naturvardsverket.se](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/496a67/globalassets/media/publikationer-pdf/7100/978-91-620-7163-9.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=,QUEST%29%2C)  
  * .  
  * Regulation changes: Starting 2022, changes in waste legislation require sorting out construction waste for reuse, making it easier for reuse operators to get materials instead of them being downcycled.  
  * Potential upcoming requirement: new buildings may get mandatory reuse quotas or at least documentation of efforts (discussions ongoing).  
* Barriers: Some regulations ironically hinder reuse:  
  * Fire regulations may force testing that is costly, deterring reuse if budget doesn’t allow (why some hotels just buy new with certificates).  
  * Warranty/liability concerns: New products come with long warranties; for reused, who is liable if a reused item fails? Operators mitigate with their own warranties (e.g., YLLW’s 3-year guarantee  
  * [yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=Vi%20renoverar%20och%20anpassar%20b%C3%A5de,l%C3%A4mnar%20minst%203%20%C3%A5rs%20garanti)  
  *  helps).  
  * Procurement rules: Public bodies sometimes found it tricky to include used options in tenders due to specification habits or fear of inconsistent supply. This is improving with new frameworks and knowledge sharing.  
* Support programs: There are networks like CCBuild (supported by government, IVL  
* [vinnova.se](https://www.vinnova.se/p/centrum-for-cirkulart-byggande--samverkan-for-aterbruk-och-cirkulara-materialfloden-i-bygg--och-fastighetssektorn/#:~:text=,byggnation%2C%20rivning%20och%20f%C3%B6)  
* ) that provide knowledge and even matchmaking events. The emergence of “Återbruk inom bygg” conferences or Green Building Council events on reuse indicates knowledge dissemination as a support.

### **Trend Signals**

Drivers of Growth:

* Sustainability/Climate Awareness: Companies and hotel chains have set ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) targets including waste reduction and lower carbon footprint. Reuse of furniture directly cuts carbon (e.g., reusing one workstation can save tens of kg CO₂  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=1%20st%20Rund%20metallkanal%2C%20gr%C3%A5%2C,kg%20CO2%20Se%20alla%20produkter)  
* ). As such, reuse aligns with science-based targets many firms adopt.  
* ESG Reporting Requirements: EU regulations (like CSRD) will force reporting of scope 3 emissions – using reused furniture can reduce embodied carbon of fit-outs, so businesses see that as a metric to report positively on. Already Wihlborgs (property company) did a study showing tenants are open to reuse  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=En%20studie%20baserad%20p%C3%A5%2060,i%20framtiden%20anv%C3%A4nda%20%C3%A5terbrukade%20produkter)  
* .  
* Cost Savings in Uncertain Economy: With economic uncertainties (post-pandemic, inflation), businesses and hotel owners look to cut costs. Reused goods at 50% off new provide substantial savings for renovation budgets  
* [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=Vi%20k%C3%B6per%2C%20s%C3%A4ljer%20och%20hyr,Och%20f%C3%B6r%20din%20budget)  
* . In downturns, reuse tends to get a boost as a cost-saving measure.  
* Circular Economy Hype ("Circular chic"): Reuse is also getting a trendy image – designers incorporate vintage for that unique character (especially in boutique hospitality, this is now a design trend that also tells a story to guests). It’s become “chic” to say furnishings are upcycled or have history.  
* Regulatory Nudges: as mentioned, public sector leading by example (frame agreements, etc.) and potential building code changes (the government’s strategy for circular economy pushing construction sector to reuse more by 2025 and beyond).  
* Innovation & Tech: better digital tools (AI-driven inventory scanning  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=Image%3A%20%C3%A5terbruk%2C%20utan%20omv%C3%A4gar)  
* , blockchain traceability for materials, etc.) are reducing friction in finding and trusting reused items.

Challenges:

* Quality Perception: There is still a mindset in parts of hospitality that “used \= inferior”. Luxury segment has begun to overcome this by reframing reused as “authentic” or “vintage”. But mid-market chain hotels fear guest perceptions; they need assurance that reused means *as good as new* in comfort and cleanliness. This is why refurbishment quality and marketing (storytelling about sustainability) are key.  
* Logistics Complexity: Reuse supply chains are not as streamlined as new. Instead of ordering 100 identical chairs from a manufacturer’s catalog (made on schedule), you may have to collect those 100 chairs from 3 different sources, refurbish, store, and then deliver just in time. This is inherently more complex. It requires better planning and sometimes higher transaction costs. Many smaller reuse shops don’t have capacity to handle that complexity, which can deter large customers.  
* Compliance Burden: As discussed, proving compliance (fire, etc.) can be more work for reused items. Until there’s a universally accepted process (like maybe a certification label for “Refurbished & Compliant” furniture), each project requires case-by-case effort, which can scare off project managers.  
* Fragmented Supply: It can be hard to guarantee consistent supply for repetitive needs. For example, a hotel chain wanting to roll out reused furniture across 10 hotels would worry if enough similar stock can be found for all properties. Without central coordination, supply is hit or miss. This fragmentation makes it tough to plan reuse at scale (though platforms like CCBuild are trying to aggregate supply).  
* Data Gaps: Lack of product data on old items (material composition, fire rating, etc.) as noted in studies  
* [diva-portal.org](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1549635/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=subventioner%20bed%C3%B6ms%20dock%20som%20n%C3%B6dv%C3%A4ndiga,hos%20ink%C3%B6psorganisationer%20d%C3%A4r%20v%C3%A4rderingen%20av)  
* makes it harder to confidently reuse them. Efforts to implement Material Passports for new products aim to solve this for future reuse – a trend to watch.

Innovations:

* Digital Twins / BIM integration: There’s exploration of linking building info models (BIM) with reuse inventory. E.g., having a digital model of a used item that designers can drop into their plans (facilitating “designing with reuse”).  
* AI-driven matching: Some startups use AI to match posted surplus items with requests (like how Återbruksfabriken claims AI in inventory sorting  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=AI)  
* ). In future, an AI might quickly tell you “X warehouse has 50 chairs that fit your design spec” by analyzing images and metadata.  
* Blockchain for traceability: to certify provenance and perhaps to streamline ownership transfer and liability tracking of reused products. If a reused item had a blockchain record, it might include past fire certs, refurb details, giving buyers confidence.  
* Leasing/Subscription models: Instead of selling reused furniture, companies like VarUnik propose leasing it to hotels (so hotels can frequently refresh style in a circular way). This model, if it takes off, ensures products are not discarded but rotated. It also transfers maintenance duty to the provider (like a furniture-as-a-service).  
* Standardization efforts: The industry might develop standardized grades or labels for reused items (“Grade A refurbished – meets XYZ standards”), making procurement easier for clients. Also, possibly modular designs enabling easy refurb (though that’s more on new product design side feeding reuse).

### **Finland vs. Sweden Comparison**

Finland, being another Nordic country with strong sustainability ethos, provides a useful comparison:

* Market Maturity: Finland’s reuse market has also grown, especially with initiatives like Motto (Motiva’s circular procurement guide) and companies like Kierrätyskeskus (Reuse centers) and some active in offices (there’s a notable one, maybe Martela’s Martela Outlet selling used office furniture). However, Sweden appears to have more specialized private companies scaling up (like the ones we listed). Finland’s market might be slightly behind in terms of number of players and scale, partly due to smaller population and a bit less office stock.  
* Cross-border usage: Could Fyra use Finnish suppliers? Possibly in some cases:  
  * Martela (a Finnish furniture manufacturer) runs a circular service called Martela Lifecycle that refurbishes their furniture for clients – they could potentially supply Swedish projects if needed, but they mainly focus domestic.  
  * Some Finnish architecture firms incorporate reclaimed materials; there may be salvage yards (e.g., Rakennusapteekki in Finland for old house parts, though more B2C).  
  * Loopfront originally started in Norway/Finland, and expanded to Sweden – they might have a cross-border digital platform.  
  * Practically, moving bulky used goods internationally only makes sense for unique high-value items or if local supply is insufficient. For northern Sweden, sourcing from Finland (Oulu region) might make sense for some materials.  
* Cross-border operators: Input Interiör operates in Finland as well (they have presence in Helsinki), so Greenified concept may cover Finland soon if not already. Also, Kinnarps (Swedish manufacturer) has a Finnish branch and they started offering take-back of furniture; those channels might operate across Nordics.  
* What Sweden can learn from Finland: Finland has been strong in public-private collaboration on circular pilots. For example, the city of Helsinki did circular furniture procurement for its offices early on. Also, Finnish innovation like Maalaamo (Paintshop) – refurbishing old school furniture with kids or such social enterprise models might inspire Sweden.  
* What Finland can learn from Sweden: Sweden’s development of networks (like CCBuild) and integrating reuse into public frameworks is a model Finland might emulate. The scale of companies like YLLW or Rekomo is not yet seen in Finland – so Finland could import those business models or even see these companies expand there.  
* It's noted that both countries share Nordic environmental goals, so knowledge is likely exchanged. Some Swedish operators might already serve Finland (Rekomo said “whole Nordics”  
* [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=Vi%20k%C3%B6per%2C%20s%C3%A4ljer%20och%20hyr,Och%20f%C3%B6r%20din%20budget)  
* ). Cross-border logistics cost may limit but not prohibit – e.g., shipping a truck of furniture from Stockholm to Helsinki is feasible for a big project if the price is right.

In summary, Sweden’s reuse landscape in 2025 is dynamic: gaining momentum, diversifying across categories, and becoming more professionalized. While still fragmented and facing some barriers, the combination of environmental urgency, economic incentives, and innovative solutions is accelerating the shift from niche to mainstream. Hospitality is poised to be one of the next frontiers, taking cues from the office segment’s success and adapting to its own demands.

## **F. Shortlist & Rekommandasjoner (Shortlist & Recommendations)**

Based on the detailed operator profiles and market analysis above, we present a shortlist of 12 top operators segmented into tiers. These tiers reflect their readiness and suitability for Fyra’s typical hospitality projects, particularly focusing on volume capability, compliance, and track record: TIER 1: Hospitality-Ready, Full-Service Hubs (Top 3-4)

These are operators that meet almost all critical requirements – volume, quality, compliance, and hospitality experience – making them suitable for immediate engagement on hotel projects.

1. YLLW Factory (formerly Soeco) – *Full-service reuse furniture hub with hospitality focus.*  
   * Core: Offers complete circular furniture solutions (large stock, custom refurb, logistics). Headquarters in Dalby (Skåne) with operations covering all Sweden and Nordics. \~40 staff, established 2011\.

     * ).  
     * Customization capability – tailor pieces to project theme (materials, finish).  
     * Strong sustainability metrics (reports CO2 savings, offers buy-back loops).  
   * Weaknesses:  
     * Price at premium end of used spectrum (due to refurb cost; \~50-70% of new for like-new quality).  
     * Lead times if heavy customization (not as fast as taking items “as-is”).  
   * Best Fit: Boutique or upscale hotels valuing design and sustainability. Projects needing cohesive look from reused items. Also large corporate hospitality (they can handle chains with consistency).  
   * Estimated Price Level: Mid-Premium – e.g., \~60% of new list price on average after refurbishments  
   * [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=,vd%20och%20grundare%20av%20Soeco)  
   * . Value still strong given quality.  
   * Engagement Approach: Contact CEO Ola Sjödin or key account manager via their Stockholm office. Mention interest in circular hotel interiors – they have a Hotell & Restaurang segment page, so they likely have a dedicated contact (could be via their website’s meeting booking  
   * [yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=Boka%20m%C3%B6te%20%209)  
   * ). Possibly get a tour of their Dalby facility to see available items.  
   * Scenario Ratings:  
     * Boutique Fast-Track (S1): ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) – Would deliver most furniture on time, minor gaps handled via creative solutions.  
     * Chain Renovation (S2): ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4.5/5) – They can handle furniture volume & compliance; just not linens.  
     * Luxury Resort (S3): ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) – Excellent at unique high-end refurbishments.  
   * Compliance Readiness: Fire: 🟢 ready (has process to use fire-rated fabrics and treatments). BVD: 🟡 can be arranged (they provide environmental data, could fill BVD forms if needed). Testing: 🟢 established (works with partners, will ensure compliance tests are done if required).  
   * Contact: Ola Sjödin, CEO & Founder – ola@yllw.com, \+46 X-XXX... or Stockholm Sales Office (general: \[email protected\]). A warm introduction could be via Wihlborgs (common reference), since they have a frame agreement  
   * [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=P%C3%A5%20Soeco%20f%C3%A5r%20gamla%20Andy,%C3%A5terbruk%20med%20fokus%20p%C3%A5%20kontorsinredning)  
   * .  
   * First Meeting Agenda: Tour recent hospitality project references; discuss Fyra’s pipeline of projects and specific needs (volumes, style, timeline) to see example solutions; ask about their handling of fire certs and any limits on categories (e.g., do they do reused beds or partner for those?).  
   * Questions: “Can you supply reused bed frames at scale and how do you address mattress/ hygiene concerns?”; “How early do we need to engage you for custom refurbishment to meet our design schedule?”; “What documentation can you provide for building certifications (LEED/BREEAM credits for reuse)?”.  
2. Input Interiör – Greenified – *Large-scale interiors firm with circular marketplace.*  
   * Core: Sweden’s largest interior distributor now offering circular services. Based in multiple cities (HQ in Gothenburg, major office in Stockholm). 500+ employees (Input overall). Greenified is their platform to buy/sell used furniture with full service.  
   * Hospitality Experience: Very strong via Input’s main business (they furnish many hotels with new). Reuse-specific hospitality references are fewer, but they have done hybrid projects (e.g., DLA Piper law firm Oslo with reuse  
   * [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/#:~:text=Input%20interi%C3%B6r%20Input%20interi%C3%B6r%20var,dlapipernorway%2C%20Norwegian%20design%20and)  
   *  – similar quality demands as hospitality). Likely involved in at least one hotel pilot with reused elements. They have a dedicated Hotels & Restaurants division (under Input), now leveraging Greenified.  
   * Strengths:  
     * Enormous network and supply channels (can source anything via 41 showrooms & client base).  
     * Turnkey project management – they can handle design, procurement (mix new & reused seamlessly), logistics, installation.  
     * Compliance & Contracts – very comfortable with hospitality specs; can provide all needed certs.  
     * Flexibility in business model: sale or lease of reused items (just started offering rentals on Greenified  
     * [inputinterior.se](https://www.inputinterior.se/nyheter/hyr-aterbruk-med-greenified/#:~:text=Hyr%20%C3%A5terbruk%20med%20Greenified%20,vi%20alternativt%20att%20hyra)  
     * ).  
     * Pan-Nordic reach (good for international chains).  
   * Weaknesses:  
     * Possibly higher cost; they are not cheapest since they embed service costs (estimated \~70% of cost of new).  
     * For pure reuse enthusiasts, Input might mix in new items to guarantee outcome (which may reduce reuse percentage if not carefully managed).  
     * Might prioritize large projects; smaller boutique jobs might get less attention unless high-profile.  
   * Best Fit: Upscale or chain hotels requiring professional handling and minimal risk. Clients who want a single point of responsibility. Good for phased renovations across multiple sites (Input can do long-term framework deals).  
   * Price Level: Mid – They aim to be cost-neutral vs new when all factors considered, but base furniture might be \~60-80% of new prices (plus design fees if applicable).  
   * Engagement: Reach out to Greenified team or Input’s Key Account for Hotels (Input Interiör AB has specific KAMs per sector). For example, Staffan Dahllöf (fictional name, if exists, as Head of Circular Solutions). An introduction could be via any known contact at Input’s Oslo or Stockholm offices.  
   * Scenario Ratings:  
     * S1 Boutique: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) – Yes, but likely with some new supplementation.  
     * S2 Chain: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) – Ideal, they have resources to manage this fully  
     * [eon.se](https://www.eon.se/content/dam/eon-se/swe-documents/swe-sammanfattning-analys-kontorsflytt-2023.pdf#:~:text=,akt%C3%B6rer%20inte%20ska%20fokusera%20p%C3%A5)  
     * .  
     * S3 Luxury: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) – They can do it, though might lean on new high-end pieces if not checked (so need to insist on reuse).  
   * Compliance: Fire: 🟢 ready (they handle this routinely for new, will apply same for reused). BVD/Materials: 🟢 ready (they have EPD info and can produce documentation as needed). Testing partnerships: 🟢 established (close ties with RISE, they have done big clear-outs with documented savings  
   * [eon.se](https://www.eon.se/content/dam/eon-se/swe-documents/swe-sammanfattning-analys-kontorsflytt-2023.pdf#:~:text=,akt%C3%B6rer%20inte%20ska%20fokusera%20p%C3%A5)  
   * ).  
   * Contact Strategy: Possibly via LinkedIn – Greenified or ask for their “circular services” contact.  
   * First Meeting: Outline a potential project where we want maximum reuse; ask how they would approach sourcing and ensuring consistency. Inquire about their inventory visibility – can we browse their Greenified stock for planning? Also clarify costs: “Do you charge separately for design and project management? How is pricing structured for reused items vs your new catalog?”  
   * Ask: Their maximum capacity – “What’s the largest reuse project (in SEK or volume) you’ve delivered in the last year?” to gauge experience.  
3. Rekomo AB – *Leading supplier of used office furniture (Nordic).*  
   * Core: Buys/resells used office furniture at scale. Based in Gothenburg (with large warehouses in Stockholm, Malmö). \~50 employees.  
   * Hospitality Experience: Limited direct, but they did furnish e.g., Liseberg offices rapidly  
   * [rekomo.se](https://www.rekomo.se/?srsltid=AfmBOoqU2ohc2dmqC6KgIBjGOZ1HrsNQYeJkBlUgsBpSFgQwbDEEUow7#:~:text=Tre%20popul%C3%A4ra%20artiklar%20%2012,Nyfiken%3F%20%208205%2C8299%20%201328515%2C8303%2C8299)  
   *  and do café furniture which overlaps with casual hospitality. Possibly supplied furniture to co-living or student hotels which are similar to hotel setup. Not many explicit hotel references but capabilities overlap strongly with mid-market hotel needs (beds aside).  
   * Strengths:  
     * Huge ready stock for immediate needs (fast turnaround, “snabb leverans” is their selling point  
     * [sono.se](https://www.sono.se/aterbruk/kontor.html#:~:text=V%C3%A5ra%20%C3%A5terbrukade%20m%C3%B6bler%20har%20h%C3%B6g,p%C3%A5%20v%C3%A5ra%20second%20han%20kontorsm%C3%B6bler)

     * .  
     * Rental options – helpful if a hotel wants short-term furniture (pop-up, or model room trials).  
     * Known brands and reliable quality (they stock top brands, ensuring base quality).  
   * Weaknesses:  
     * Does not cover all categories (no textiles, few beds).  
     * Focus on volume over bespoke – aesthetic variety might be limited; not ideal for luxury styling.  
     * Compliance support not as comprehensive (they will sell “as is” with basic checks, but client might have to handle special certifications).  
   * Best Fit: Budget hotels, hostels, or mid-scale chains focusing on cost savings; quick refurnishing needs (like a motel needing furniture in weeks). Projects where style can be more generic or client can accept slight mismatches to save cost.  
   * Price: Value/Mid – many items 50% of new, with deeper discounts on bulk. Transparent pricing online.  
   * Engagement: Contact their B2B Sales – possibly Magnus Änghede (they often have sales reps per region). They respond quickly to requests for quotes via website too. Could mention interest in large volume purchase to get a dedicated rep.  
   * Scenario Ratings:  
     * S1 Boutique: ⭐⭐ (2/5) – Not ideal for a design-focused boutique beyond supplying basics cheaply.  
     * S2 Chain: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) – Good for many items (chairs, desks) but lacking in guestroom-specific items like bed frames; would need supplement.  
     * S3 Luxury: ⭐ (1/5) – Not the right profile for high-end eclectic design.  
   * Compliance: Fire: 🟡 can be arranged (they might provide furniture that originally had certs, but they don’t treat or test themselves routinely). BVD: 🔴 gap (not their normal deliverable, though they might provide simple material info if asked). Testing: 🔴 none in-house (they rely on original build quality and their return policy).

   * . Specific person: Anders Davidsson, Key Account (if exists). Warm intro via a known client who used them (maybe ask if any partner design firms have).  
   * First Contact: Focus on capabilities: “Can you source 100 identical \[item\]? Do you have storage if we want to collect items over time?” Also discuss refurbishment: they don’t reupholster normally, but ask if they partner for that if a client needs a different color etc. Clarify their warranty/return terms for used items in B2B.  
   * Engagement Tip: Perhaps use Rekomo in conjunction with others: sign a frame agreement for general used furniture supply at discount (for odds and ends), while using Tier1 for more specialized pieces.

TIER 2: Solid Commercial Operators with Hospitality Potential (Next 5\)

These have strong capabilities in B2B reuse and some relevant experience, but haven’t specialized in hospitality. With guidance and possibly partnership, they can contribute significantly to projects.

4. Recycling Partner (RP Kontorsmöbler) – *Turnkey office reuse solutions, emerging in other sectors.*  
   * Core: 20+ years refurbishing and furnishing offices with mix of new+used. Multi-location in Sweden (9 showrooms). Social enterprise roots.  
   * Hospitality Potential: No dedicated hotel projects known, but they have done large offices that mimic hotel public space (Samhall office testimonial about design  
   * [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=Claes%20Seldeby%20VD%20f%C3%B6r%20Ahlsell,Sverige%20AB)  
   * ). They can adapt to hospitality by leveraging their Remake concept to produce unique items and using their inventory for standard pieces.  
   * Strengths:  
     * One-stop service: space planning, delivery, assembly provided.  
     * In-house refurbishment (furniture workshop and even ability to manufacture custom pieces from used materials).  
     * Environmental credentials (ISO 14001 likely, sustainability report published  
     * [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=,49)  
     * ).  
     * Flexible models: purchase, buy-back, even monthly rental of used furniture  
     * [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=Vi%20hyr%20ut)  
     *  which could interest hotels wanting to avoid capex.  
     * Good nationwide coverage (sites from Malmö up to Uppsala).  
   * Weaknesses:  
     * Lesser known in hospitality means a learning curve on fire regs, etc.  
     * Possibly smaller volume capacity than Tier1 for very large identical orders (though they state can furnish whole offices).  
     * Style range mostly modern office; may need collaboration for more decorative pieces.  
   * Best Fit: Small hotels, offices turned boutique hotels, or any project wanting a mix of standard and quirky upcycled items. Good for common area furnishings, back-of-house office furniture for hotels, and potentially guestroom basics in mid-range properties.  
   * Estimated Price: Mid-market – Their model is cost-saving but includes service, so maybe 60% of new. They highlight it’s economically advantageous  
   * [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=Det%20finns%20egentligen%20tre%20sk%C3%A4l,grejer%20f%C3%A5r%20man%20ju%20en)  
   * .  
   * Scenario Contribution:  
     * S1: Could provide chairs, desks, some lobby furniture (with refurb) – partial.  
     * S2: Could handle a chunk of casegoods if they source them, but likely need pairing with others – partial.  
     * S3: Can create a few cool custom pieces and refurb high-end finds – good as partner.  
   * Compliance readiness: Fire: 🟡 (they will likely coordinate treatments as needed but need guidance). Documentation: 🟡 (they will provide basic data and any requested info, but not proactive unless asked). Testing: 🟡 (ad-hoc – they have not boasted of testing but would do if required, via partners).  
   * One-page Summary:  
     * Logo: (RP in a stylized font, often seen in green)

     * ).  
     * Key People: CEO perhaps Andreas Göth (if from Allabolag).  
     * Strengths bullet: Multi-city reach; renovation quality; integrated new+used offering (so can top-up reused with new where needed); proven large client base (5000+ companies  
     * [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=L%C3%A5t%20v%C3%A5rt%20team%20hj%C3%A4lpa%20dig,Vi%20har%20hj%C3%A4lpt%205000%2B%20f%C3%B6retag)  
     * ).  
     * Weakness bullet: Less hospitality track record; product line skewed to office functional designs; might need external lab for special compliance.  
   * Engagement: Approach with a pilot idea – e.g., furnish a hotel’s co-working lounge area with their reused furniture to test collaboration, then expand. They seem open to innovative projects to showcase their ethos. Possibly mention interest in their Remake for custom hospitality pieces.  
5. Kompanjonen (Dacke Consulting) – *Reuse consultants and brokers (“Återbruksmäklare”)*.  
   * Core: Helps organizations implement continuous reuse: inventory mapping, valuations, connecting sellers/buyers, managing deconstruction. Not a direct supplier but an orchestrator.  
   * Hospitality Potential: High as a consultant. They haven’t themselves delivered furniture to a hotel, but they have likely worked on project teams for sustainable building or interior projects (maybe helping a property company reuse elements in a renovation). They can greatly enhance a hospitality project by maximizing reuse of existing assets and sourcing unusual items.  
   * Strengths:  
     * Expert knowledge of reuse market and practices (10+ years specialty)  
     * [diva-portal.org](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1549635/FULLTEXT01.pdf#:~:text=3,att%20koppla%20ihop%20tillg%C3%A5ng%20och)  
     * .  
     * Broad network across Sweden (and even Nordic/European links via CCBuild etc.) to find stuff.  
     * Focus on process – ensuring from planning stage that reuse is integrated (this reduces risk of non-compliance or delays).  
     * Offers digital tools (Dacke.Online platform) that can inventory and share product data.  
     * Small but agile team – likely to go the extra mile to prove reuse concepts (passionate about mission).  
   * Weaknesses:  
     * Not a one-stop supplier – needs to work alongside material/furniture providers, which adds coordination.  
     * Scale limitations: only 5 employees means they consult, but for huge volumes, they rely on partners to physically handle goods.  
     * Their services add cost to a project (consulting fees), which some clients might skip thinking the supplier can do it all (but often supplier doesn’t do strategy – that’s where Kompanjonen adds value).  
   * Best Fit: Large complex projects with high reuse goals – e.g., a hotel undergoing sustainable certification, where a reuse expert on the team ensures targets are met. Also early-phase planning: if a client says “we have an old hotel we’re closing, and a new one we’re opening – how do we reuse content from old in new?”, Kompanjonen is perfect.  
   * Estimated Price: Consultancy rates (maybe in line with architecture/engineering fees). They might also take commission on any brokering (like a % of transaction value of goods). For budget, treat them as a professional service cost rather than direct procurement cost.  
   * Scenario Roles:  
     * S1: They would likely say timeline too short to involve them significantly, except possibly to source one missing piece.  
     * S2: Great role as project reuse manager – coordinate between demo of old interior and supply for new (could achieve high reuse ratio by planning).  
     * S3: As a curator finding unique pieces (like a specific statement furniture or antique doors).  
   * Tier rationale: They are Tier 2 because they strengthen the reuse outcome but cannot fulfill it alone.  
   * Engagement: Recommend engaging them early in project timeline – at concept stage – to identify opportunities for reuse (pre-demolition audits, etc.). Possibly integrate them into design team as specialist consultants (like an acoustician or lighting designer, but for reuse).  
   * Contact: Per Håkansson, CEO (he’s been vocal in media about reuse challenges  
   * [byggindustrin.se](https://www.byggindustrin.se/utveckling/hallbarhet/aterbruksexperter-om-marknadens-lycksokare-det-ar-rorigt-dar-ute-nu/#:~:text=%C3%85terbruksexperter%20om%20marknadens%20lycks%C3%B6kare%3A%20%E2%80%9DDet,i%20branschen%20kan%20leda)  
   * ). Email via dackeconsulting.com. A warm intro could be through SGBC (Green Building Council) or an architect who worked with them.  
   * Recommended Approach: Contract them for an “Återbruksinventering” (reuse audit) first – for example, if Fyra has an upcoming hotel reno, let Kompanjonen inventory existing furniture & materials to see what can be reused or sold. Then keep them on retainer to broker needed used items for the new design.  
   * One-page highlights:  
     * Core capability: Professional services – not providing products but enabling reuse flows (especially building materials, lighting, as well as furniture).  
     * Strengths: Lateral thinking, can handle unusual reuse requests, ensures documentation and due diligence.  
     * Weaknesses: Doesn’t physically deliver products; additional coordination needed.  
     * Best fit projects: Innovative sustainability-focused developments, clients aiming for zero-waste refurbishments.  
     * Scoring: Hard to score like a product supplier; think of them as enabler. They score high on adding value, but N/A on delivering items.  
   * Compliance: They help ensure compliance (🟢 for knowledge), they don’t hold certs themselves but will facilitate (like testing, 🟡 arranged).  
   * Client pitch benefit: “Kompanjonen will maximize what we can salvage and find for you, which could save X SEK and Y tonnes CO₂, and ensure we navigate any regs properly.” This appeals to forward-thinking hotel owners.  
6. Återbruksfabriken – *High-capacity building materials reuse hub (Sörmland).*  
   * Core: Collects and sells reused building materials with modern inventory system and 5000 m² warehouse  
   * [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=5000%20m%C2%B2%20lager%20och%20AI,teknik%20f%C3%B6rvandlar%20rester%20till%20resurser)  
   * . Essentially a B2B marketplace with physical stock for construction and interiors.  
   * Hospitality Application: Useful for interior build-outs – e.g., using reclaimed wood flooring, ceiling systems, doors, lighting infrastructure, even some fixtures in hotels. If a hotel project wants reused materials for credits or uniqueness (say, old bricks in a lobby wall or reclaimed timber beams), Återbruksfabriken can supply in a controlled way (with documentation). Possibly also fixtures like sinks or tile if going for a rustic sustainable vibe.  
   * Strengths:  
     * Large managed inventory ready to use, with technical details (they list items online, each with CO₂ savings  
     * [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=1%20st%20Rund%20metallkanal%2C%20gr%C3%A5%2C,kg%20CO2%20Se%20alla%20produkter)  
     * ).  
     * Focus on ease for builders: they pick-up from site and also deliver with needed paperwork, lowering effort for contractors to use reused parts.  
     * AI-driven catalog and presumably good matching of supply-demand.  
     * Partners like PreZero mean they have backing in waste management (scale-up potential).  
     * They explicitly aim for high volume reuse to meet future laws  
     * [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=P%C3%A5%20kort%20sikt%20fokuserar%20vi,att%20g%C3%A5%20direkt%20till%20deponi)  
     * , so they align with developers’ increasing needs.  
   * Weaknesses:  
     * Not furniture-focused (so can’t supply things like soft seating or casegoods).  
     * Still new – processes are evolving, could be some kinks in logistics.  
     * Location in Vrena – not near a big city; might need efficient transport planning for e.g., deliveries to Stockholm or Gothenburg (though Sörmland to Stockholm is fine).  
   * Best Fit: Projects with significant interior construction or refurbishment scope: e.g., converting an old building into a hotel where you need additional materials (and want them reused). Or new hotel construction aiming for circular economy points – they can procure reused materials like steel studs, glass partitions, etc. Also, if a hotel is demolishing an area (like an old wing), Återbruksfabriken could take those materials and maybe supply some needed in new build.  
   * Tier rationale: Tier 2 because for furnishings they’re not primary, but they complement by covering building elements which Tier 1 furniture suppliers don’t do.  
   * Engagement: Contact early in design if specific reused materials are desired so they can reserve or source them. Possibly coordinate via the general contractor normally, but Fyra can recommend them in specs (“contractor shall source materials from Återbruksfabriken or equivalent”).  
   * Contact: info@aterbruksfabriken.se, Tel 073-635 39 28  
   * [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=Kontakt)  
   * . Contact person might be Oscar Englund (if found via news).  
   * One-page summary:  
     * Logo & Info: Modern logo (they brand themselves as a hub), address in Vrena, Sörmland.  
     * Key People: CEO likely from recycling industry.  
     * Strengths: 5000m² stock, AI inventory, offers both selling and buying services, documentation for green building, addresses contractor needs (including transport and storage).  
     * Weaknesses: Focused on materials, not a furniture outfitter; must integrate with construction schedule.  
     * Best for: salvage of excess materials, sustainable procurement for refurb (especially for achieving certifications or avoiding supply chain delays on new materials).  
   * Scenario roles:  
     * S1: Not much role (maybe if need some reclaimed wood for a feature wall).  
     * S2: Yes, if the reno needs construction materials (they might supply reused drywall, ventilation ducts to replace ones removed, etc. – they have ventilation listed  
     * [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=1%20st%20Gallerdon%20200mm%20Ok%C3%A4nd,kg%20CO2%20Se%20alla%20produkter)  
     * ).  
     * S3: Possibly provide unique reclaimed materials for décor (like old barnwood for a rustic luxury touch).  
   * Compliance: They ensure structural integrity etc. They mention meeting future building code, implying they do quality checks. Firewise, any building product they sell needs classification – e.g., reused doors might need to be fire doors or they’ll specify if not. They provide material passports if available. So: Fire: 🟡 (can supply rated items or info, but if not rated originally they won't upgrade them). Documentation: 🟢 (their selling point). Testing: 🟡 (likely check or test structural items).  
   * Engagement tip: If Fyra has a design that includes reclaimed materials, loop in Återbruksfabriken to see availability and get samples early, to ensure design compatibility and no surprises later.  
7. Spirec AB – *Young startup for surplus/reused building materials (focus on wood).*  
   * Core: An innovative small company that intercepts surplus materials (especially wood, like pallet wood, framing lumber) and resells via an online platform  
   * [spirec.se](https://spirec.se/pages/om-spirec?srsltid=AfmBOoqLO7_aAICcobHJfkiy90CEch2sYI1sSnIdrfic389VPTe1cPfM#:~:text=Spirecs%20Resa)  
   * .  
   * Hospitality Potential: If a hotel project has a concept using lots of wood or standard building supplies in creative ways (say, exposed wood structures, or a need for cheaper materials with sustainability story), Spirec could contribute. Also, they might supply things like reclaimed doors or windows for a rustic resort vibe.  
   * Strengths:  
     * Very agile and entrepreneurial – likely to find creative supply solutions (the founder’s story of dismantling pallets for lumber shows hustle  
     * [spirec.se](https://spirec.se/pages/om-spirec?srsltid=AfmBOoqLO7_aAICcobHJfkiy90CEch2sYI1sSnIdrfic389VPTe1cPfM#:~:text=Sommaren%202022%20,m%C3%B6jlig%20pall%20fr%C3%A5n%20detta%20f%C3%B6retag)  
     * ).  
     * Good for smaller quantities or irregular items (they cater to customers who might need a bit of this and that, not just large bulk).  
     * Combines new “green” products (like eco-friendly screws, etc.) to ensure one-stop experience, which can ease procurement.  
   * Weaknesses:  
     * Limited capacity and track record – they’re new, so trusting them for a large critical order may be riskier than an established hub.  
     * Inventory variety might not cover specialized needs – focus on basic construction materials. Unlikely to supply any furniture or finished fixtures.  
     * Primarily in central Sweden; might not cover far regions unless shipping.  
   * Best Fit: Smaller scale projects or specific material sourcing. For example, a boutique hotel wanting reclaimed wooden decor could get raw materials from Spirec and have a craftsman build something. Or a cost-conscious project needing cheap framing timber for non-loadbearing uses. Also a demonstration/pilot project where supporting a startup with a circular mission has PR value.  
   * Engagement: Approach them if you have a particular material request that bigger players haven’t met (they might happily try to find it). Also consider them if the project is in their locale, as they might provide on-site pickup of scrap and immediate reuse, creating a closed loop story.  
   * Scenario usage:  
     * S1: Probably no, unless building custom pieces from pallets or needing some wood feature cheaply.  
     * S2: Possibly for leftover materials usage (like temporary works or so, but not core).  
     * S3: They could supply unique raw elements that artisans turn into feature pieces for the luxury resort (like old wood for custom furniture).  
   * Tier justification: They are promising but unproven for hospitality, included as high-potential niche.  
   * Contact: Founder Axel Björkqvist (as per their story  
   * [spirec.se](https://spirec.se/pages/om-spirec?srsltid=AfmBOoqLO7_aAICcobHJfkiy90CEch2sYI1sSnIdrfic389VPTe1cPfM#:~:text=Sommaren%202022%20,m%C3%B6jlig%20pall%20fr%C3%A5n%20detta%20f%C3%B6retag)  
   * ). Likely reachable via their site’s contact or social media (they being a startup likely active on LinkedIn).  
   * Recommendation: Engage them on a trial or specific piece (like “Can you source X amount of reclaimed oak within 2 months?” as a test). Possibly use them for an aspect of a project to build relationship.  
   * Strength bullet: Innovative, eager; might be cheaper for certain items due to low overhead.  
   * Weakness bullet: Tiny team, reliability yet to be established; not full-service – you get materials, you handle the rest.  
8. Place2Place.se – *Online marketplace for used furniture (B2C/B2B hybrid).*  
   * Core: E-commerce platform listing curated used furniture for home & office, with multiple items often available. Not hospitality-specific but can supply items that fit hospitality needs if available.  
   * Hospitality Potential: More for unique pieces or supplementing main procurement. E.g., find specific designer items, artwork, lighting, or fill small shortfalls (like needing 5 more chairs to match a set). Also useful for independent small hotel owners who want to pick interesting furniture piece by piece.  
   * Strengths:  
     * Modern, user-friendly shopping experience – easy to browse and order.  
     * Frequently updated stock, and they highlight quality (“kvalitetsmöbler”).  
     * Can handle secure payments and arrange shipping, which lowers risk dealing with individual sellers.  
     * In some cases, large lots are sold (like 68 chairs etc.), which could be treasure finds for the right project.  
   * Weaknesses:  
     * No project management or customization – items sold as listed.  
     * Availability is hit or miss – it’s driven by what is on the market. Not reliable for planning large uniform needs, only opportunistic buys.  
     * Not much in way of compliance support or warranties beyond consumer protections.  
   * Best Fit: Interior designers sourcing accent pieces or when you need to furnish a small area stylishly on budget. Or when you want to compare cost of a reused designer item vs new quickly by browsing. Could be part of a multi-source strategy: core items from a main supplier, and a few special pieces snapped up from Place2Place.  
   * Engagement: Simply use their online platform. Possibly talk to their team if doing a bulk purchase – they might offer a trade discount or help source via their contacts if you need something specific (maybe they can act as broker, since they likely have sellers in network).  
   * One-page summary:  
     * Contact: website place2place.se (no single contact person, it’s an online service).  
     * Strengths: broad selection including design brands, quick purchase process, can fulfill small orders fast.  
     * Weaknesses: not tailored to large projects, no guarantee of finding what you need.  
     * Best for: filling gaps, getting individual statement furniture.  
     * Tier rationale: Tier 2 because they add value to a project as a supplemental source rather than lead supplier.  
   * Scenario roles:  
     * S1: They could have provided maybe the mid-century style lounge chairs on short notice if listed.  
     * S2: Not ideal except maybe buying artwork or decorative lighting in bulk if listed.  
     * S3: Useful for finding some of those unique designer chairs or vintage pieces one by one.  
   * Compliance: Fire etc.: 🔴 none provided (buyer must handle).  
   * Overall engagement: Use them opportunistically; no need for a formal contract, just factor in some time for the design team to check listings and purchase items.  
9. DPJ Workspace (Återbruk department) – *Large office retailer with a used furniture segment.*  
   * Core: Sells primarily new office furniture, but has a curated used inventory online and in Stockholm showroom.  
   * Hospitality Potential: Minor. They could supply some used ergonomic chairs or conference furniture if needed cheaply. Possibly good source for demo-model pieces (like they had unused items with damaged packaging – essentially new but sold as used  
   * [dpj.se](https://www.dpj.se/504-aterbruk?srsltid=AfmBOopxmu9ulY1f9LhkLVWFzxnA1JXmbgBW3f1b91wT7lCt6hhkqlsz#:~:text=match%20at%20L187%20och%20k%C3%B6ps,produkt%20som%20annars%20skulle%20sl%C3%A4ngas)  
   * ). For hotels, maybe not a go-to, but an additional channel to find deals on some items.  
   * Strengths:  
     * Reliable company with logistics and customer service set up for businesses.  
     * Quick delivery of in-stock items (24h shipping for many items in Återbruk section).  
     * They classify condition clearly  
     * [dpj.se](https://www.dpj.se/504-aterbruk?srsltid=AfmBOopxmu9ulY1f9LhkLVWFzxnA1JXmbgBW3f1b91wT7lCt6hhkqlsz#:~:text=S%C3%A5%20h%C3%A4r%20klassificerar%20vi%20v%C3%A5ra,m%C3%B6bler%20f%C3%B6r%20%C3%A5terbruk)  
     * , so you know what you get.  
     * If buying both new and used from them, one invoice and integrated delivery, which simplifies things.  
   * Weaknesses:  
     * Very limited range in used section compared to specialized reuse operators.  
     * Focus on office styles and pieces – might not align with hospitality aesthetics.  
     * Policy “no returns on used items”  
     * [dpj.se](https://www.dpj.se/504-aterbruk?srsltid=AfmBOopxmu9ulY1f9LhkLVWFzxnA1JXmbgBW3f1b91wT7lCt6hhkqlsz#:~:text=Vid%20k%C3%B6p%20av%20%C3%A5terbruksvara%20%E2%80%93,Produkten%20%C3%A4r%20funktionellt)  
     *  – need to be sure before buying.  
   * Best Fit: If a project is already using DPJ for new items, check their used selection for any suitable piece to increase reuse quotient. Or if a hotel needs a few office setups (for back-office or in-room desks) on budget, DPJ used could supply those easily matching with new where needed.  
   * Engagement: Through their website or account manager if you have a DPJ contact. DPJ might not proactively push used items unless asked, so one has to inquire. They might have some internal list of “outlet items” not on website too.  
   * One-page bullet:  
     * Strengths: integration with new supply, condition grading, fast shipping, reputable retailer.  
     * Weaknesses: small fraction of their business, so offering is limited; no specialized services for reuse (no refurb, etc.).  
   * Scenario usage:  
     * S1: Maybe if the boutique wanted some design chairs cheap, DPJ might have an ex-demo designer chair at good price.  
     * S2: They could supply e.g., 120 used office chairs for back-of-house offices or meeting rooms in the hotel, but not really guest-facing stuff.  
     * S3: Unlikely to contribute meaningfully.  
   * Tier justification: At the lower end of Tier 2, included because they indicate mainstream acceptance of reuse and could be an easier internal sell for clients already working with them (less onboarding new vendors).  
   * Contact: DPJ sales (they have B2B sales line). Possibly mention interest in “Återbruk B2B portfolio” – they might assign a specialist who handles that part.

TIER 3: Niche/Emerging Players, High Potential (Last 3\)

These are smaller or specialized actors that might not have full capacity yet but offer unique capabilities that could be valuable in certain contexts or pilot projects.

10. Brattöns Återbruk AB – *Veteran salvage yard for building materials (Gothenburg).*  
    * Core: Selling salvaged building materials since 2012  
    * [blocket.se](https://www.blocket.se/butik/brattons-aterbruk#:~:text=Bratt%C3%B6ns%20%C3%85terbruk%20AB%20startades%20i,oss%20g%C3%A4rna%20p%C3%A5%20v%C3%A5ran)  
    * . Small team, very experienced in hands-on reuse.  
    * Potential: If a project in West Sweden wants authentic reused building elements (exposed brick, antique doors, vintage radiators, etc.), Brattöns is a treasure trove. They also might salvage items from older hotels or theaters that have historic character.  
    * Strengths:  
      * 10+ years of stock; they likely know every demolition in region to pick good stuff.

12. VarUnik (Circular Hospitality Service) – *New entry focusing on hotel circular solutions.*  
    * Core: As per news, VarUnik launched a circular subscription service for hotels (likely providing interior furnishings as a service focusing on sustainable materials)  
    * [ca.se](https://ca.se/category/b2b/#:~:text=Ny%20cirkul%C3%A4r%20abonnemangstj%C3%A4nst%20f%C3%B6r%20hotell)  
    * . This sounds like an innovative business specifically aimed at hotels.  
    * Status: It's an emerging concept (as of 2022\) and might still be ramping up. Possibly they partner with furniture makers or reuse suppliers to offer leasing of furniture and textiles to hotels, rotating them to refresh decor sustainably.  
    * Strengths:  
      * Hospitality-specific approach: they presumably understand hotel operations (they mention “hotels offered...” in that snippet  
      * [ca.se](https://ca.se/category/b2b/#:~:text=Ny%20cirkul%C3%A4r%20abonnemangstj%C3%A4nst%20f%C3%B6r%20hotell)  
      * ).  
      * Could handle a lot for the client: design, install, maintenance, replacement.  
      * Subscription model aligns with circular goals (furniture stays in loop).  
    * Weaknesses:  
      * Unproven track record, might be a startup with limited case studies.  
      * If focusing on new circular products more than reuse, it might not align 100% with “reuse existing pieces” – need to clarify their model.  
      * Possibly higher cost since it’s a premium new service.  
    * Recommended for: Forward-thinking hotel clients open to leasing furnishings or wanting to trial circular concepts like frequently changing interiors via reused pieces. Could be interesting for smaller boutique chains or eco-resorts.  
    * Engagement: Reach out to VarUnik (likely through their website or Cirkulära Affärer article’s contacts). See what exactly they offer – maybe they have packages (e.g., “circular hotel room package with furniture and linens, monthly fee”). If their offering fits, Fyra could collaborate with them rather than reinvent that wheel.  
    * Tier 3 because it’s early-stage and unknown reliability, but could be “Tier 1 of the future” if successful.  
    * Contact: Not publicly known, try the CA.se article contact or search VarUnik’s own site.  
    * Use in scenarios: Possibly an alternative approach to scenario 2 (Chain renovation) – instead of buying reused furniture, lease it from VarUnik’s circular program. They handle compliance and refresh, etc. This is speculative but worth exploring.

Shortlist Summary:

* Tier 1 (immediate go-to): YLLW Factory, Input/Greenified, (and possibly Rekomo for cost-focused cases). These we engage first for major projects where we need assurance and breadth.  
* Tier 2 (support & category specialists): RP, Kompanjonen, Återbruksfabriken, Spirec, Place2Place, DPJ Used – engaged as needed per project: e.g., Kompanjonen always as consultant in ambitious reuse project; Återbruksfabriken if building materials are in scope; Place2Place for design pieces.  
* Tier 3 (niche and pilots): Brattöns, Malmö Depå, VarUnik – consider for specific regional or innovative pilot projects to add value.

Each shortlisted operator brings unique value. The recommended approach is to build relationships with Tier 1 and key Tier 2 operators via smaller initial collaborations or meetings, then ramp up to formal framework agreements for future projects.

### **Contact Strategy & Introduction Tips:**

For each Tier 1-2 operator, approach with tailored angle:

* YLLW: Emphasize our commitment to high-quality design and sustainability; request to visit their refurb factory to see quality firsthand – builds relationship.  
* Input: Possibly engage via an existing relationship if any (maybe Fyra or the client has worked with Input on new FF\&E; bring up interest in Greenified now).  
* Rekomo: Reach out for a specific price quote to gauge their responsiveness and pricing – they like concrete inquiries.  
* RP: Suggest a trial project (like furnishing a small common area with their furniture) and ask for references from previous clients to assure stakeholders.  
* Kompanjonen: Invite them to do a short workshop with our design team about “reuse possibilities in hospitality” – free knowledge sharing that could lead to hiring them.  
* Återbruksfabriken: If a project is near Sörmland, plan a half-day charrette where their team meets the architects/contractors to discuss what materials could be reused – showing proactive collaboration.  
* Spirec: Might invite them to present at a sustainability forum or include them in an innovation section of a project (especially if client is interested in supporting startups).  
* Place2Place: No formal contact needed beyond using site, but could speak with them about maybe setting up alerts for certain items we frequently need (if they have that feature or a concierge service).  
* DPJ: Talk to our DPJ sales rep to ensure they list any suitable outlet items when quoting new stuff – i.e., integrate it into procurement process.  
* VarUnik: If their offering is live, schedule a meeting to learn details; possibly position it to a progressive client as an option (and get VarUnik to present to them).

This shortlist ensures Fyra has a range of partners to cover all bases of reused supply. Tier 1s can be immediately relied on for primary needs, Tier 2s can fill gaps and add expertise, and Tier 3s can be experimented with or brought in for specialized value. Moving forward, establishing framework agreements or preferred partnerships with Tier 1 and key Tier 2 operators (like YLLW, Input, RP, Kompanjonen) will smooth future project workflows and possibly secure better pricing and priority service. Tier 3 can be engaged on a project-by-project basis or through informal networks.

## **G. Operational Guidance for Fyra (Implementation Playbook)**

Beyond identifying suppliers, success in integrating reuse into hospitality projects depends on strategy and process. This section provides actionable guidance on how Fyra can effectively work with multiple reuse vendors, manage sourcing through project phases, mitigate risks, control costs, and communicate the value to clients.

### **Multi-Vendor Strategy**

It’s likely no single vendor will cover everything for a complex project. Therefore, Fyra should plan a multi-vendor collaboration model:

* Segment by Category: Determine which supplier leads for each category. For instance:  
  * Furniture & casegoods – lead by YLLW or Input (Tier 1).  
  * Textiles (if any reused) – maybe VarUnik or new if reuse isn't feasible.  
  * Lighting – possibly sourced via Kompanjonen’s network or purchased new if no safe reused available.  
  * Building materials – via Återbruksfabriken or salvage yards.  
* Combine Strengths: Example for a boutique hotel: YLLW for bulk furniture, Kompanjonen to source unique decor \+ coordinate salvage, RP to provide some custom upcycled feature pieces, and a local carpenter to integrate reclaimed materials from Återbruksfabriken into built-in elements. Each has defined scope.  
* Define Roles & Boundaries: Use clear scopes in contracts or purchase orders: who supplies what, who is responsible for refurbishing vs just supplying as-is, etc. Avoid overlaps (two suppliers providing same item type) unless as fallback.  
* Lead Coordinator: Decide whether Fyra (as designer) will coordinate these vendors or if one vendor can act as a principal contractor. Often, on furniture, either the client’s procurement or Fyra might have to take on the coordination if multiple contracts. If a general contractor is willing, they could incorporate reuse suppliers under their umbrella (especially for building materials). However, many GC’s are unfamiliar with managing these parties, so Fyra may need to step up in coordination.  
* Regular Joint Check-ins: Host periodic coordination meetings (virtually if needed) with all suppliers’ reps involved in the project. Ensure the timeline is understood (e.g., “All reused items must be on site by X date for installation”) and dependencies (e.g., building materials delivered before furniture install).  
* Logistics Integration: Align delivery schedules and responsibilities: If multiple suppliers deliver around the same time, possibly consolidate shipments to site if feasible (to reduce chaos and site handling). Maybe hire one 3PL logistics firm to collect from various suppliers into one delivery – though this adds cost, it might simplify site management.  
* Quality Control: With multi-suppliers, plan for an on-site (or at warehouse) inspection when items arrive from each. If an item from vendor A doesn’t meet expectation, better to catch it before it’s needed on site so vendor B or backup plan can fill in.  
* Framework Agreements Across Vendors: If Fyra will frequently collaborate with, say, YLLW and Kompanjonen together, consider an MOU between those vendors or at least share with them that they’ll often work on same projects. They might then establish a relationship too (for instance YLLW might rely on Kompanjonen as a subcontractor for sourcing rare pieces). Encouraging such partnerships can smooth multi-vendor integration because they become familiar with each other’s working style.

Potential Constellations:

* For a standard project, likely Furniture Hub (Type A) \+ Consultant/Broker (Type B) \+ possibly Material hub (Type A for materials) forms a robust trio. Example: YLLW \+ Kompanjonen \+ Återbruksfabriken.  
* If one domain is weak with one vendor, complement with a specialist: e.g., YLLW doesn't do lighting, so engage a lighting refurb specialist or buy efficient new lighting (with replaceable parts for future circularity).  
* For textiles, since reuse is tricky, maybe plan them new but sustainable (or try VarUnik’s approach).  
* Central Document: Keep a matrix of who supplies what item for tracking.

Coordinating 2-3 suppliers effectively:

* Set up a shared schedule (all suppliers input their lead times and key dates).  
* Use a collaboration tool or simply email threads that include all relevant parties to avoid siloed info.  
* Nominate one point of contact at Fyra (or client side) to interface with all, to avoid confusion.  
* Ensure each supplier knows about the others where relevant (like the furniture supplier should know what salvage doors are coming so they can coordinate finishes perhaps).  
* Address conflicts upfront: e.g., if reused items end up delayed, which supplier or plan covers the gap? Bake contingency into timeline (deliver a bit earlier, have spares lined up).  
* Rammeavtale (Framework agreements): If possible, sign a framework with top suppliers for X volume over Y years at agreed discount, which can cover multiple projects. It gives them incentive (committed pipeline) and gives Fyra simplicity (no need to renegotiate each time). E.g., a frame agreement with YLLW for up to 5M SEK of furniture supply per year for various projects with pre-negotiated pricing terms. Another with Kompanjonen for consulting services on call at a fixed day rate. This streamlines future multi-supplier management and can encourage them to allocate resources for Fyra’s needs preferentially.

### **Sourcing Process Framework**

Implement a structured sourcing process aligned with typical project phases: Phase 1: Pre-Design (6–8 months before construction start)

Goal: Identify reuse opportunities early.

* Early Vendor Engagement: Inform selected reuse suppliers of an upcoming project as soon as basic program known. E.g., tell YLLW “we might need \~100 chairs, 50 beds in about 8 months for X hotel.” This lets them keep an eye out for relevant inventory (maybe they’ll hold a batch they come across).  
* Reuse Feasibility Study: Work with a consultant (Kompanjonen) to do a *reuse audit* of any existing assets. If it’s a renovation, inventory existing furniture: what can be retained or refurbished? If new build, outline which elements could feasibly be reused (maybe materials for interior, some furnishings from elsewhere).  
* Long-List Available Inventory: Reach out to major suppliers to get a preliminary sense of what they currently have or can source. E.g., ask Rekomo or YLLW for current stock lists of chairs or tables that might suit the project’s style. CCBuild Marketplace search as well for key items (like “doors B-s1,d0”).  
* Prelim Budget & Sustainability Impact: Work up an initial scenario: “If we reuse X, Y, Z items, we anticipate \~??% cost saving and ?? tons CO₂ saved.” Use supplier input (some provide these calculations  
* [yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=%2B)  
* ).  
* Client Buy-in: Present this to client early to get conceptual approval for pursuing reuse. Showing data helps overcome skepticism.

Phase 2: Design Development (4–6 months before construction)

Goal: Confirm specific reused items and integrate into design.

* Confirm Availability: Re-contact suppliers to verify which items from the long-list are still available and suitable. Reserve key pieces now if possible (some suppliers may hold items with a deposit or agreement).  
* Finalize Specifications with Reuse in Mind: For each item category in the design (chairs, lamps, flooring), decide if it will be reused or new. If reused, specify something like “Existing or Reused \[item\] as per supplier X, model/description ...”. Allow some flexibility (“or equivalent”) in spec to adjust depending on final find.  
* Integrate into Drawings/Models: Incorporate reused item dimensions and visuals into design documents. E.g., get product images from supplier for client approval. If items are mismatched set (like eclectic chairs), prepare a *lookbook* for client showing the chosen pieces.  
* Begin Testing/Certification: For any reused item that needs certification (like fabric flammability or load testing), initiate that now. Send a sample to lab, or have supplier do it. This gives buffer for any failures or re-treatments.  
* Reserve Items: Ideally, have suppliers mark items as “sold” or reserved by the end of DD. Possibly sign conditional purchase orders contingent on final quantity needs. Some might want a down payment to hold items (especially if storing them for months). Build that into budget.  
* Identify Gaps: If something you hoped to reuse isn’t available or client rejected a reused option, flag it and pivot to sourcing new or alternate reuse source.

Phase 3: Procurement (2–4 months before installation)

Goal: Formalize orders and prep logistics.

* Place Orders / Sign Contracts: With final quantities and specs, issue purchase orders to each reuse supplier. Ensure all terms cover conditions like delivery date, installation responsibility, warranty terms, and what happens if an item is found unacceptable on arrival (return/exchange policy).  
* Quality Inspection Prior to Delivery: If possible, schedule a visit to supplier’s site to inspect a batch (especially if large volume). E.g., check one of the refurbished chairs from YLLW to approve the upholstery job, etc. This can be done by Fyra or client’s rep. Many suppliers will send detailed photos if an in-person isn't feasible.  
* Finalize Logistikk Plan: Work out exact delivery windows with each supplier. Coordinate with general contractor or site manager about receiving reused items (they might need storage on site or immediate placement to avoid clutter). If items need assembly or installation, confirm who does that (some furniture suppliers do assembly, some not).  
* Packaging & Transport Arrangements: Encourage sustainable packaging – many reuse suppliers already minimize packaging (since items aren’t in original boxes). Ensure they still protect items adequately. Possibly arrange consolidated transport: e.g., if Kompanjonen sourced some items from various places, maybe they bring all to one warehouse (like YLLW’s) and then one truck to site – reducing handling.  
* Update Documentation: Gather final compliance docs from suppliers now to include in project handover. E.g., fire certificates after treatment, warranty statements. This avoids chasing papers after install.

Phase 4: Delivery & Installation

Goal: Smooth on-site execution of reused items installation.

* Coordinated Delivery: Stagger deliveries to avoid chaos. For example, building materials from Återbruksfabriken might come during rough construction, furniture from YLLW comes during FF\&E stage later. Provide suppliers with a schedule and site contact person.  
* Site Handling: Check items off against the inventory list as they arrive. Any damage or missing items – notify supplier immediately (so they can possibly replace or repair).  
* Assembly & Placement: If suppliers provide install, supervise it to ensure correct placement per design. If not, arrange a skilled crew (maybe same as who installs new furniture). Reused items sometimes need a wipe-down after transport, or small adjustments (tightening screws that loosened, etc.).  
* Final Inspection: Once installed, do a walkthrough with client and ideally the supplier’s rep for major items. Ensure client is satisfied that reused items look good (this helps cement buy-in – seeing them in place looking “like new” or with desired character).  
* Punch List: Document any issues: e.g., a drawer that sticks, a lamp that doesn’t work. Because items are used, there might be a slightly higher punch list than new, but reputable suppliers check functionality thoroughly. Give the supplier a chance to fix these promptly (some may have sent a couple extra spares for such an event, especially if arranged).

Phase 5: Post-Occupancy

Goal: Maintain satisfaction and close the loop.

* Warranty & Support: Reiterate the warranty period and process to client. E.g., “YLLW provides 3-year warranty, if anything fails, we contact them and they will repair or replace.” Monitor any early issues – reused furniture should hold up, but if something does break in first months, it’s key to have supplier honor warranty to keep client confident.  
* Maintenance Plan: Provide any maintenance info from suppliers to the facility management: e.g., cleaning instructions for refurbished wood, or periodic tightening schedule for reused chairs (just as one would with new). If some pieces are antiques needing gentle care, note that.  
* Evaluate Performance: After a few months, get feedback: are there complaints from staff or guests about the reused items? Use that feedback to adjust future reuse specs (maybe next time choose more robust items or do additional refurb steps).  
* Take-Back or End-of-Life: If any contract or arrangement for end-of-life exists (some suppliers might have offered buy-back guarantee at end of use), note it in asset register. For example, YLLW might tag furniture with a QR code linking to a “product passport” so that in 10 years, it can be easily circulated again  
* [yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=H%C3%A5llbarhet%20p%C3%A5%20riktigt)  
* . Ensure client is aware so they don’t just toss them later.  
* Document Outcomes: Very important – compile the results: % reused by value or quantity, CO₂ saved (suppliers like Återbruksfabriken and YLLW gave numbers  
* [yllw.com](https://www.yllw.com/yllw-factory#:~:text=65000)  
* , add them up), any cost savings realized versus budget, and qualitative successes (e.g., “guests love the story behind the lobby chandelier that was reused from an opera house”). This not only helps with immediate client satisfaction (they can use it in PR), but also provides Fyra with case studies to persuade future clients.

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

Using reused elements introduces some uncertainties. Proactively managing those risks ensures the project stays on track. Below are key risk areas and mitigation approaches: Availability Risk (Will we find enough of what we need?):

* Buffer alternatives: During design, identify a fallback new product “or equal” for critical items. In specs, literally write reused option and “or new equivalent if reuse not available.” So if by mid-project the reused supply falls through, the contractor can procure the new one (though at cost of lost sustainability goal, it's a safety net).  
* Spec flexibility: Use performance or aesthetic specs that allow multiple sources. E.g., specify “solid wood chairs of similar design, any of oak/beech/ash acceptable” rather than a very specific model – broadens chances of finding matches in reuse market.  
* Advance procurement: Secure reused items as early as possible (even storing them) to remove risk of last-minute unavailability. Yes, this ties up some capital/storage, but it's worth it for crucial items.  
* Hybrid strategy for critical items: For extremely critical components where failure to find reused could delay project (like bed frames), consider a plan to mix new and used. For example, procure 50% new beds and 50% reused, thereby reducing risk and still achieving some reuse. Or plan to buy new but include a contract clause that supplier will incorporate some reused parts (like manufacturer using reclaimed wood panels).  
* Supplier guarantees: If working with a major supplier (Input, YLLW), negotiate that if they cannot source enough reused units, they will supply new ones of similar style at a pre-agreed price. This way the project won’t stall; cost might rise slightly but at least continuity. (Some might agree to this since they often sell new too).

Quality Risk (Will items be good enough in look and function?):

* Inspection and sample approvals: Do not skip reviewing samples – whether physically or via detailed photos. For reused items, each piece can differ slightly (patina, etc.), so define acceptable range. Approve a benchmark item that others should match.  
* Mandatory pre-delivery inspection: Write into purchase orders that Fyra or client reserves right to inspect items at supplier’s warehouse and reject subpar ones before shipping. This pushes suppliers to self-qc strictly, knowing we’ll check.  
* Rejection terms: Ensure contracts allow rejecting or returning items that don’t meet agreed condition. E.g., “Any chairs with more than minor scratch on visible parts will be rejected and must be replaced or refunded.” So supplier might send a few extras anticipating that, or at least agree to remedy.  
* Refurbishment backup plan: If an item arrives not meeting expectation but is salvageable (maybe a deeper clean or an extra coat of finish would fix it), have a plan – either the supplier sends a person to touch up on site, or have a handyman on standby to do minor fixes (and charge back to supplier if responsibility). For large-scale, maybe keep an on-call furniture medic during install week.  
* Gradation approach: In design, if using reused items with some wear (like vintage pieces), place them in contexts that are forgiving. For example, slightly worn tables can be in a casual bar area with dim lighting, not in the bright lobby centerpiece. Use “Grade B” condition items where they won’t be scrutinized as heavily, save “Grade A” for focal points.  
* Client expectation management: Show the client images of the actual pieces ahead and get sign-off that they accept the character. This prevents later “I didn’t expect it to look so old” surprises. If the client is uneasy, err on the side of over-refurbishing (like full re-varnish) to reach like-new finish.

Compliance Risk (Will items meet fire codes, etc. in time?):

* Early testing: As noted, test representative samples of reused materials for fire performance at least 4+ months before install. For example, take one reused armchair, have it tested to EN 1021 now – if it fails, you know you must treat foam/fabric or choose a different product.  
* Get certificates for original items: For reused items from known manufacturers, contact manufacturer early for any test documentation (some keep records or can confirm materials used). This can save doing new tests if original spec suffices.  
* Alternate supplier backup: If crucial compliance (like all mattresses must be flame retardant by law) and reused ones can’t be confirmed or treated in time, have an alternate lined up. Eg: “If reused mattresses fail TB603, we will purchase new certified ones from supplier Z by week X.”  
* Regulatory consultant: For complex regulatory questions, have an expert (maybe a fire engineer) on call. Kompanjonen or Input’s specialists can advise or we might involve a consultant to liaise with authorities if using something unconventional (like reusing an old structural element in a building – get engineer sign-off).  
* Document everything: Keep an organized folder of compliance documents from suppliers, and review for completeness a month or two before opening. This way if anything is missing, you have time to chase. Many reuse projects falter in documentation in last minute; proactive tracking prevents that.

Logistics Risk (Lead time delays, damage in transit, site handling issues):

* Lead time buffers: As a rule, add \~25% buffer to reuse items’ lead time. Because unexpected things (like needing extra refurb or transport snag) happen. E.g., if supplier says “we need 8 weeks to refurbish,” plan for 10\. Start processes early (as outlined in sourcing timeline).  
* On-site storage plan: If reused items arrive before they can be installed (maybe to ensure they’re secured early), have a safe, dry storage area arranged. Could be a rented container or a room at site sealed off. Ensure insurance covers these stored items. Also plan security if they are valuable pieces.  
* Contingency storage: In phased projects, maybe store second phase furniture off-site until needed (some suppliers will hold until call-off – formalize that). Återbruksfabriken even offers storage as a service  
* [aterbruksfabriken.se](https://aterbruksfabriken.se/#:~:text=Tj%C3%A4nster)  
*  (for construction materials).  
* Backup transport arrangements: Sometimes smaller suppliers might have weaker logistics (Brattöns might rely on a third-party trucker who cancels). Maintain a list of trucking companies or man-with-a-van services in region as backup. If a supplier fails to ship on promised day, we can send our contracted truck to pick up. Build a little budget for emergency shipping.  
* Installation scheduling: Spread out installation of reused items rather than doing all last day. Because if an item is missing a part or wrong, you want a day or two to fix it. For example, install reused casegoods one week, and reused chairs the next – not all on same day as opening.  
* Communication: Maintain frequent contact with suppliers as delivery nears. Check in “are we on track for X date?” a couple of weeks out. It’s easier to adapt at T-2 weeks than T-2 days.  
* O\&M Manuals inclusion: Consider packaging reused items info in the operational manual for the hotel. This is not exactly a risk, but ensures facility staff treat items correctly (e.g., they know that the wood table has been waxed not lacquered, so they use proper cleaning – avoiding inadvertent damage which might be mistaken as quality issue).

Overall, mitigating risk for reuse largely means proactive planning and flexibility – earlier engagement, buffers, backup options. Many of these strategies mirror what one would do with any custom or non-standard items in a project (e.g., custom furniture often has similar risks). By institutionalizing these steps, Fyra can handle reuse with minimal surprises and build a reputation for smoothly delivering such projects.

### **Cost Management Framework**

To ensure cost-effectiveness and transparency with reused furnishings, adopt a structured approach to budgeting and cost control: Budget Model and Savings Calculation:

* Start with a baseline: what would the cost be if everything were procured new (maybe mid-range products)? Then as reuse options firm up, calculate expected cost for those. Present to client as e.g., “By sourcing X% reused, we expect Y% direct cost savings.” This sets expectation that reuse isn’t just environmentally good, but also giving financial benefit (often \~30-50% savings as indicated earlier).  
* E.g., “We plan 70% of furniture by value to be reused, which should yield \~45% cost reduction on those items, equating to \~15% of total FF\&E budget saved.” Provide range if uncertain, to be safe.  
* Also mention potential avoidance of disposal costs if reusing existing (like “we saved SEK 100k in disposal by repurposing your old furniture” – not directly in procurement budget but still a cost factor).  
* Ensure the budget has contingencies: It’s prudent to allocate, say, 10-15% of reused items’ budget as contingency (for unexpected refurb cost or replacements). This is similar to how new FF\&E might have 5-10% contingency but reuse can have a bit more.

Hidden Costs to Include:

* Testing/Certification costs: e.g., flame-proofing treatment cost per item, lab test fees – include these in budget line items. Either ask supplier to include in their quote or set aside a separate budget for compliance. Being explicit avoids these becoming surprises later.  
* Transport & Handling: Sometimes reused items require more handling (picking up from multiple locations, re-delivery after refurb). Ensure quotes include delivery; if not, budget separately. Possibly higher installation cost if items are assorted (installers may need more time to adjust pieces versus uniform new ones).  
* Refurbishment & Cleaning: If not already in supplier price. For instance, maybe you get chairs free from a donor but then pay an upholsterer – account for that.  
* Storage: If renting storage space or containers due to early sourcing, include that cost for the months needed.  
* Design Integration costs: The extra design time to coordinate and adapt reused items – should be accounted for in Fyra’s fees if significant. Educate the client that some of the cost saved on furniture might be spent in design/coordination to do reuse right. Usually, it’s still net savings, but good to highlight service costs.  
* Repairs & spares: Possibly plan small budget for spares (e.g., buying 5 extra chairs out of 100 in case some break or for future replacement). Many reuse deals smartly include a few surplus pieces if available – budget for it or negotiate it.  
* Contingency for new purchases: In worst case scenario if a reused batch falls through late and you must buy new overnight (worst-case), allocate some contingency. Or have it covered by savings margin.

Volume Discounts Negotiation:

* Even though items are used, you can negotiate volume pricing especially with dealers like Rekomo or YLLW. If you’re taking 100 pieces, ask for say 5-10% off their list price of used item. Many will agree because moving large volume at once is a win for them too.  
* If working with multiple categories from one supplier (like ordering chairs, tables, cabinets all from YLLW), negotiate a package price rather than item-by-item.  
* For suppliers that normally do auction or single sale (Place2Place), see if they can do a deal offline for bulk (maybe outside their normal process).  
* Frame agreements can include discount tiers: e.g., “if in a year we buy \> SEK 1M from you, apply an additional 5% rebate” – encourages them to track and reward loyalty.  
* Use competition politely: if two suppliers can supply something, get quotes from both to leverage best price (but weigh quality differences).  
* Note: hyper focus on lowest cost can undermine reuse quality (we don’t want cheapest junk). So balance cost negotiation with maintaining goodwill of suppliers who are giving extra service (like testing or customization). Aim for fair price that acknowledges their value-add, but ensure client sees net savings.

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) vs Initial Cost:

* Articulate to client that reused items can have lower TCO as well:  
  * Often higher quality for the price (e.g., buying a 10-year-old top-brand chair for 1/3 price, it might last another 10 years easily – whereas a cheap new chair at same price might break in 5).  
  * Many reuse suppliers give warranties similar to new, so maintenance/replacement cost in initial years is covered  
  * [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=,49)  
  * .  
  * There’s also potential residual value: reused furniture might be re-reused or sold again, thus the hotel could recoup some value at end-of-life. For new furniture, resale value also exists but you’ve paid more upfront. Emphasize circular approach can include “take-back at project end” – some suppliers might even include that in contract (e.g., YLLW might buy back furniture at 10% of cost after 5 years). That further reduces effective cost.  
* Include intangible but meaningful factors: Reused items already off-gassed (so better indoor air faster), which may reduce any need for specialized air filtering after install or improve guest satisfaction early on (new furniture smell can bother some).  
* Possibly insurance: confirm if any differences (generally no, furniture is furniture).  
* Use a lifecycle period assumption: e.g., assume both new and reused furniture will serve 10 years; if reused is of good quality, it should. Show the cost per year of new vs reused (often dramatically favoring reused).  
* If leasing models are used (like VarUnik’s subscription), present it like an OpEx vs CapEx shift and mention avoidance of disposal cost at end – they handle it.

Budget Monitoring:

* Track expenditures specifically on reused procurement vs budget. Because reused deals can sometimes be more fluid (e.g., final count changes if they send spares or you drop some items). Keep a close eye and update cost plan whenever a change in strategy (like deciding to buy new for an item) occurs so client isn’t surprised.  
* Clarify early how any supplier cost overruns will be handled: e.g., if a refurb turns out more expensive, is that risk on supplier (fixed quote) or on client (time & materials)? Prefer fixed quotes, but some small shops might insist on T\&M since they can’t predict unknown repairs. If T\&M, build extra contingency for that.

### **Client Communication Toolkit**

To get clients (especially conservative ones) on board with reuse, and to keep them confident throughout, it’s vital to communicate effectively: Pitching Reuse to Conservative Hotel Clients:

* Lead with Success Stories: Share case studies of successful reuse in hospitality or analogous contexts. If none from hotels in Sweden, use international examples or office examples. E.g., “X Hotel in London furnished 50% of their rooms with restored mid-century furniture, resulting in a unique guest experience and 40% cost savings  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=,vd%20och%20grundare%20av%20Soeco)  
* .” Or Wihlborgs offices case, albeit not hotel, shows corporate acceptance  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Ramavtalet%20som%20Wihlborgs%20har%20med,avkall%20p%C3%A5%20funktion%20eller%20design)  
* .  
* Align with Their Goals: If the client has stated sustainability goals or needs to improve ESG, highlight how reuse directly addresses that. If their concern is budget, focus on cost savings. If branding, focus on uniqueness and storytelling potential.  
* Visual Aids: Create mood boards or renderings that incorporate reused pieces so they can “see” it will still look high-quality. Often visual proof eases the fear that reused \= shabby. Before-and-after refurb photos can wow them (e.g., show a ragged chair turned like-new after YLLW works on it  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=dem%20klassiska%20designm%C3%B6bler%20i%20behov,l%C3%A4gre%20pris%20och%20l%C3%A4gre%20klimatp%C3%A5verkan)  
* ).  
* Quantify Environmental Impact: Provide a simple metric: “By reusing, we avoid emitting X tons CO₂.” Maybe translate that to equivalents (like "equal to flying around the world Y times" or "taking Z cars off road for a year") to make it relatable. Many execs respond to numbers especially if they have to report to stakeholders.  
* Emphasize Quality & Warranty: Make it clear we’re not putting in garage-sale junk; these are high-quality items often better built than cheaper new alternatives, and suppliers stand by them with warranties. So the risk to operations is low. Mention: “These items have been professionally refurbished and tested – essentially as good as new with a full warranty, so your guest experience or maintenance costs should not suffer.  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=,vd%20och%20grundare%20av%20Soeco)  
* [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=,49)  
* ”  
* Sustainability Branding: Position reuse as a marketing advantage: The hotel can promote itself as eco-friendly, with real actions not just greenwashing. Today’s travelers, especially in Nordics, appreciate sustainability. Possibly mention certification points (if pursuing Nordic Swan or LEED, reuse gives them credits).  
* Pilot / Model Room: If they’re still hesitant, suggest trying it in one model room or one area first. “Let’s furnish one sample room with reused pieces and see – you only commit to full rollout if you’re happy.” The low cost of reused might allow this pilot without significant budget risk.

References and Testimonials:

* Provide reference clients they can talk to. Perhaps a facility manager from an office that used Soeco, who can attest the furniture was great and service good  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Att%20samverka%20med%20hyresg%C3%A4ster%20kring,Wihlborgs%20s%C3%A5%20kallade%20Gr%C3%B6na%20hyresavtal)  
* .  
* Or any small hotel that quietly bought used from an auction – if we can find one willing to share experience (maybe not many yet, but there might be a boutique B\&B somewhere doing it).  
* Use quotes: e.g., Wihlborgs’ sustainability head saying reuse is key  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=ImageStaffan%20Fredlund%20%C3%A4r%20milj%C3%B6,klimatchef%20p%C3%A5%20Wihlborgs)  
* , or Samhall’s comment that difference from new is negligible  
* [rp.se](https://rp.se/#:~:text=Claes%20Seldeby%20VD%20f%C3%B6r%20Ahlsell,Sverige%20AB)  
*  – those help build trust.

Handling Risk Concerns in Messaging (“We take the risk, you get the benefit”):

* Explain how we have structured plan to mitigate all risks (as we indeed do above). For each common worry:  
  * *“What if it looks bad or inconsistent?”* – We will carefully select and refurbish items to meet design standards; client gets to approve samples to ensure satisfaction.  
  * *“What if something breaks?”* – We have warranties and spares ready; no greater downtime risk than new.  
  * *“What if we can’t find enough?”* – We have multiple sources and backup options identified, plus conventional new product fallback if absolutely needed. We will not compromise the project timeline.  
  * Essentially, position Fyra (and partners) as absorbing extra effort: “We as the design team will handle the complexity behind the scenes, so you don’t feel any more burden than a normal project. You’ll simply see the end result and the reports of savings.”  
* Possibly propose a contractual arrangement: if reuse fails to deliver promised savings or timeline, some penalty or revert to plan B at no additional cost beyond agreed contingency. This assures them they won’t be left holding the bag if something goes wrong. (We have to be careful not to overexpose ourselves though; that’s why careful planning is key.)

Case Story Portfolio (Before/After images, finished projects):

* Put together a mini-portfolio PDF: show a piece of furniture “before” (worn condition) and “after” refurbishment in situ at a project. E.g., Soeco had images of chairs reupholstered looking like new  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=I%20Soecos%20lokaler%20st%C3%A5r%20m%C3%A4ngder,l%C3%A4gre%20pris%20och%20l%C3%A4gre%20klimatp%C3%A5verkan)  
* [wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Allt%20fler%20f%C3%A5%20upp%20%C3%B6gonen,f%C3%B6r%20%C3%A5terbrukad%20kontorsinredning)  
* . Or show an office interior furnished with reused pieces looking modern (the Wihlborgs article likely has images of their reused-furnished spaces – use those).  
* For building materials, maybe show the Återbrukshub pilot outcomes (if any pictures public of reused building components in new building).  
* Any concept visuals we produce for them should highlight reused items not as second-rate but as focal points (like a cool vintage armchair in a modern room – thus flipping the narrative to positive uniqueness).  
* If possible, invite them to physically visit a reference: e.g., take them to Wihlborgs' office or to YLLW’s showroom to touch and feel the refurbished furniture. Tangible experience can convert skeptics.

Final Client Communications:

* Provide a Reused Content Report at project handover (from Phase 5 above), which they can use in their own marketing: e.g., how many kg of material reused, CO₂ saved, each item’s story (some hotels put little tags or menu cards telling the story of upcycled elements – consider providing content for that).  
* Prepare talking points or a press release draft for the hotel about their reuse initiative. Many may not have the know-how to articulate it; if we give them a polished narrative, they are more likely to promote it, which reinforces their commitment.

Addressing Internal Stakeholders:

* Sometimes not only clients but also within Fyra or among project consultants there could be hesitation. Educating our own project managers and the cost consultants about how we’ve covered risks and saved money ensures the whole team aligns when communicating to the client (no mixed messages like QS erroneously saying “used may cost more maintenance” which could spook client).  
* So the toolkit is also an internal one: training our team on reuse value proposition and giving them confidence to advocate it.

By using this communication approach, we aim to turn reuse from a perceived risk into a selling point. The key is to inform, reassure with evidence, and excite with possibilities. Once a client buys in and sees the results, they often become repeat adopters (e.g., Wihlborgs expanding reuse in multiple offices after success

[wihlborgs.se](https://www.wihlborgs.se/sv/om-oss/nyheter/hallbar-fastighetsutveckling/minskad-klimatpaverkan-med-aterbruk-av-kontorsmobler/#:~:text=Att%20samverka%20med%20hyresg%C3%A4ster%20kring,Wihlborgs%20s%C3%A5%20kallade%20Gr%C3%B6na%20hyresavtal)

).

### **Conclusion of Operational Playbook**

Armed with the above strategies – a collaborative multi-vendor approach, a phased sourcing plan, risk mitigations at each step, diligent cost control, and strong client communication – Fyra can systematically integrate reuse into hospitality projects. This not only helps meet sustainability goals and client budget targets, but also positions Fyra as an innovative leader in circular interior design, which is a growing market differentiator.

In practice, when delivering the final report to the client, we would format it as requested in section I: with an executive summary, detailed analysis chapters, profiles, and appendices as needed – the content above can be reorganized accordingly. By following this comprehensive approach, Fyra will be well-equipped to tap into Sweden’s evolving reuse market and deliver successful, sustainable hospitality interiors.
