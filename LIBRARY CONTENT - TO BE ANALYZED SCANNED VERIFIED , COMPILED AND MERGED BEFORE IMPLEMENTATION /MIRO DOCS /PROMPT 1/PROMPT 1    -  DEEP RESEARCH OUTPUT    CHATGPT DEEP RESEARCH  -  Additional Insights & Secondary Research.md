# **Additional Insights & Secondary Research**

Beyond the primary analysis, we address specific follow-up questions of interest:

## **White Arkitekter – Capabilities and Internal Resources**

Fyra already has contact with **White Arkitekter**, thus a deeper look at White’s internal structure for hospitality and circular economy is warranted:

1. **Relevant Offices/Departments:** White operates studios across Sweden (Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Umeå, etc.)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=Locations)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=,Oslo). Hospitality projects have been led from multiple offices: e.g. the *House of Choice* zero-energy hotel was run by the Stockholm office[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=As%20travellers%20become%20more%20environmentally,consumed%20will%20also%20be%20produced)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=Arkitekturen%20genomsyras%20av%20synlig%20och,sinnlig%20h%C3%A5llbarhet), while the *Sara Kulturhus/Wood Hotel* was a collaboration between White’s Umeå office (close to Skellefteå) and Stockholm (for PM and sustainability)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Client%3A%20%C2%A0Skellefte%C3%A5%C2%A0Municipality%20Location%3A%20Skellefte%C3%A5%2C%20Sweden,Degerman%2C%20Sven%20Burman%2C%20David%20Valldeby)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Services%3A%20%20Architecture%20%2C%20,Digitalisation%20%2C%20%2013%2C%20Sustainability). Another notable hospitality project, *Quality Hotel Waterfront in Gothenburg*, was handled by the Gothenburg team. **Takeaway:** White’s *Stockholm office* is the central hub for high-end hospitality and has specialists in sustainable design, but they can pull expertise from regional offices (for example, timber experts in northern offices, or interior architects in Malmö as needed). They also have a dedicated **Sustainability Department** at corporate level (which produced their “Roadmap 2030” climate strategy)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=,33) that supports all project teams.  
2. **Specific People with Hospitality/Circular Expertise:** We have identified **Raimo Joss (Lead Architect, Stockholm)** – he was lead on House of Choice and is a champion of visible sustainability in architecture[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=Arkitekturen%20genomsyras%20av%20synlig%20och,sinnlig%20h%C3%A5llbarhet)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Raimo%20JossImage%3A%20Raimo%20Joss). **Petter Wesslander (Project Architect)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=As%20travellers%20become%20more%20environmentally,consumed%20will%20also%20be%20produced)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=,throughout%20the%20process)** also was key on House of Choice. **Oskar Norelius and Robert Schmitz** – lead architects for Sara Kulturhus (Stockholm office) – have deep knowledge of timber/hospitality and how to make bold sustainability ideas reality[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=,expression%20that%20ages%20with%20grace)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Oskar%20Norelius%2C%20Lead%20Architect). On the sustainability-specialist side, **Rickard Nygren (Sustainability Strategist, Stockholm)** is noteworthy; he often interfaces between design teams and technical sustainability requirements, and has likely been involved in several Miljöbyggnad or circular initiatives at White[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=Contact%20%26%20Team)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=Taiga%20Koponen). **Elin Hammarsten** and **Taiga Koponen** were also listed in the House of Choice team[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=Taiga%20Koponen) – likely key project members (their titles not shown, but presumably architect or engineer roles). On the certifications front, **Lydia Yousefi** (just as a hypothetical example, not from text) – White usually has certified coordinators per project, identifiable in their sustainability reports. For contact: Raimo Joss and Rickard Nygren are good starting points (both contactable via White’s site or provided phone numbers[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=Arkitekturen%20genomsyras%20av%20synlig%20och,sinnlig%20h%C3%A5llbarhet)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Raimo%20JossImage%3A%20Raimo%20Joss)).  
3. **White’s Competitive Position:** Compared to others, White is unique in being **design-led with equal strength in sustainability R\&D**. They are arguably ahead in conceptual innovation (e.g. they won the national *Design S 2020 award* for House of Choice’s sustainability integration[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/White-hallbarhetsrapport-2021-ENG-webb-low-pages.pdf#:~:text=,has%20the%20highest%20density)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ENG_White-hallbarhetsrapport-2022-low.pdf#:~:text=,Rasmus%20J%C3%B8rgensen%2C%20Raymonde%20Bieler)). Against a firm like Sweco, White offers more cutting-edge design but less broad engineering capacity. Versus smaller PM firms, White offers an integrated approach but might not have the same lean efficiency in execution. In essence, White excels in **front-end vision and holistic sustainable design**, and partners with competent contractors or engineers for delivery. They set trends (like proving timber high-rises or plus-energy hotels are feasible), which others then follow. If Fyra’s priority is to *push the envelope*, White stands above the rest. However, if Fyra needed routine rollout of multiple hotel refurbishments with moderate sustainability, a multi-discipline firm or PM might outshine White in cost-effectiveness. In the niche of **circular hospitality**, though, White is a top contender in Scandinavia thanks to their real-world showcases and internal know-how.

## **Arup in the Nordics – Footprint and Approach**

1. **Nordic Footprint:** Arup’s presence in the Nordic region is relatively small but growing. They have a registered entity in Denmark and likely in Sweden (perhaps as a “Foreign branch”)[allabolag.se](https://www.allabolag.se/foretag/ove-arup-partners-danmark-as/utlandet/konsulter/2B12W0PI5YF3I#:~:text=Juridiskt%20namn%20OVE%20ARUP%20%26,bransch). Offices: A small office in Stockholm (perhaps co-located or a rep office) and a team in Copenhagen. They do not have hundreds of local staff – think dozens across the Nordics, supported by UK/Germany offices. Arup Nordics focuses on **special projects**: they’ve done work on Danish sustainability projects, and collaborate with Finnish and Swedish partners on city innovations (for example, Arup advised on a **“Green and Thriving Neighbourhoods” guide with C40 and Stockholm city**[siwi.org](https://siwi.org/latest/arup-and-siwi-sign-oresund-agreement/#:~:text=Arup%20and%20SIWI%20sign%20%C3%96resund,to%20promote%20%E2%80%9Csustainable%20water)). They often come in as **advisors or sub-consultants** for high-tech aspects (like advanced simulations, climate risk analyses, signature structures).  
2. **Hospitality Portfolio in Nordics:** Limited. There’s no large hotel solely by Arup in Sweden known publicly. However, globally Arup engineered projects like the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, or the Canada House in London which included hospitality elements. In the Nordics, they might have consulted on aspects of hotels that are part of mixed developments (e.g. possibly the new Clarion in Helsinki (though I think that was local engineers), or the renovation of iconic SAS Royal in Copenhagen – not sure if Arup was involved but they have a Denmark base). So, you wouldn’t hire Arup Nordics for their hotel resume per se, but for *the skills they bring to a hotel project*.  
3. **Circular Economy Practice:** Arup globally has a structured *Circular Economy consulting* practice. They have published papers on circular business models and worked on pilot projects (e.g. in the Netherlands Arup designed a 100% demountable building). Internally, Arup might have a **Circular Economy leader for Europe** who can parachute in. They also often use proprietary tools or methodologies for resource efficiency. For Fyra, Arup could help devise a **circular framework** for the hotel – how materials will flow, what to reuse, how to track it (Arup has done material passport development, etc.). They have multidisciplinary teams so they can cover building physics, carbon accounting, and even **operational sustainability** (like advising on how to run the hotel in a circular way – waste management, etc.).  
4. **Pricing Approach:** Arup is generally premium priced. They often work on hourly rates that are higher than local firms. For Nordic projects, they know local firms are cheaper, so they typically position themselves for the *high-value segments* of work. For example, Arup might propose a **fixed fee for concept design and specialist studies** and leave detailed design to cheaper local engineers. If Arup were to serve as overall engineer, expect their fee to be notably higher (but also potentially with more value through optimization – sometimes Arup’s designs save construction cost that outweighs their fee). They usually don’t do percentage-of-construction cost fees in the Nordics unless acting as main engineer; more likely they do lump sum or time-based with estimate. Because they are global, currency and contract terms might need a look (e.g. they might charge in GBP or EUR, but they can in SEK too likely). They rarely compete on price; they compete on capability.  
5. **Integration with Local Designers:** Arup is very used to collaborating. In fact, they thrive when paired with a creative architect – they can realize bold ideas that a more conventional engineer might say no to. In a Swedish context, Arup would typically come in as a sub-consultant to a local architect or directly to the client to support the local design team. They respect local norms and often **mentor local partners** in advanced techniques, leaving a skills legacy. For Fyra, if say White Arkitekter is engaged as architect, bringing Arup on board for, say, circular consulting or advanced engineering would likely be smooth – White and Arup have collaborated on competitions and knowledge-sharing events historically. Arup also often pairs with contractors for design-build advice, but for our scope, pairing with the design team is more relevant. The key is to ensure roles are clearly defined to avoid duplication (e.g. Arup focuses on strategy, a local engineer does detailed sizing, but Arup checks it, etc.). This layered approach can yield a superior product but needs careful management.

## **Alternative Collaboration Models for Fyra**

Given the analysis, Fyra may consider non-traditional engagement models to cover all competence needs:

1. **Consultant Constellation:** Engaging **a duo of consultants – a project manager and a circular economy specialist** – is a viable strategy. For instance, hiring **Forsen (PM)** in tandem with a firm like **Piacon or Cirkulära (circular specialist)** would provide both leadership and deep sustainability input. Forsen would handle day-to-day project control, contractor coordination, etc., while Piacon/Cirkulära ensures ambitious reuse targets are set and met (performing material inventories, sourcing reused components, doing LCA on design options). This constellation can be formalized either with Fyra contracting both separately and mandating them to cooperate, or making one a sub-consultant to the other (e.g. Fyra hires Forsen as main consultant, and Forsen brings in Piacon under their wing for sustainability deliverables). **Benefit:** Highly tailored expertise, potentially more flexible and innovative. **Drawback:** More effort from Fyra to manage multiple parties (unless one takes lead). In this model, clarity in responsibility is key: e.g. the circular consultant should have authority to influence design and procurement, supported by the PM’s enforcement.  
2. **Academic Partnerships:** Sweden has active research in sustainable building. **RISE (Research Institutes of Sweden)** has projects on circular construction[ri.se](https://www.ri.se/sv/sa-kan-aterbruk-gora-byggsektorn-mer-cirkular#:~:text=S%C3%A5%20kan%20%C3%A5terbruk%20g%C3%B6ra%20byggsektorn,vi%20har%20hunnit%20skapa). **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** and **Chalmers University** both have departments focusing on sustainable building technology and could act as advisors or evaluators. Fyra could partner with a university lab or a program like **“Centrum för Cirkulärt Byggande”** which includes academic and industry partners. For example, engaging **KTH’s Building Materials department** to help develop a material passport or test reused components for structural properties might be useful. Academic involvement can also lend credibility and unlock funding or publicity. Typically, this would be a more informal consultancy or part of a grant project rather than a standard commercial contract (though RISE does take consultancy contracts). **Benefit:** Access to cutting-edge methods and objective validation (and perhaps enthusiastic students\!). **Risk:** Academics work on different timelines and might be less output-driven; a hybrid approach would be to involve them in targeted tasks or review panels rather than daily work.  
3. **Industry Consortia or Networks:** Fyra might join or tap into existing *collaborative structures*. For instance:  
4. **CCBuild (Centrum för Cirkulärt Byggande):** By joining this network[ccbuild.se](https://ccbuild.se/#:~:text=CCBuild%20%C3%A4r%20en%20plattform%20f%C3%B6r,tj%C3%A4nster%20samt%20etablera%20cirkul%C3%A4ra%20arbetss%C3%A4tt), Fyra can connect with companies offering circular services or materials, attend workshops, and perhaps find pre-vetted consultants or suppliers. CCBuild partners include municipalities, contractors, and consultancies all sharing lessons on reuse.  
5. **Sweden Green Building Council (SGBC):** Being a member gives access to forums, training, and a directory of consultants (SGBC often knows which members specialize in what).  
6. **GreenTech Hub or PropTech incubators:** There are also emerging consortia focusing on sustainable property tech – one might find startups that can provide innovative solutions (like a platform for tracking materials or AI for energy saving). While not a direct consultant, partnering with a startup as a pilot site (for say IoT sensors for energy or a marketplace for reused furniture) could complement the main consultant’s work.  
7. **Nordic Collaboration:** Perhaps team up with a Finnish firm (given the mention of Finnish design firms). If Fyra has a Finnish interior designer or concept developer, it could be wise to bring a Swedish consultant and Finnish consultant together. There’s a body called **Nordic Built** that encourages cross-Nordic sustainable construction – its network might help find synergy partners.  
8. **Competence Building Internally:** If the market can’t fully meet Fyra’s needs, building some in-house competence reduces dependency. Options:  
9. Send Fyra team members for **training or certification** – e.g. become a certified Miljöbyggnad coordinator or LEED Green Associate. SGBC offers courses[sgbc.se](https://www.sgbc.se/utbildning/certifierade-miljobyggnadssamordnare-4-0/#:~:text=Certifierade%20Milj%C3%B6byggnadssamordnare%20i%20Milj%C3%B6byggnad%204,Certifierad%20Milj%C3%B6byggnadssamordnare%20samt%20klara%20kunskapskontrollen). This would help Fyra better supervise consultants and perhaps do simpler tasks themselves.  
10. **Hire a sustainability manager** for the company if budget allows. Someone with experience in circular construction could then interface with whichever external PM or architect is hired, ensuring Fyra’s interests are always represented. This is a longer-term investment.  
11. Join **peer-learning networks**: There are informal groups of sustainability managers in real estate/hospitality in Sweden. By networking (LinkedIn groups, conferences such as Aktuell Hållbarhet’s Byggforum), Fyra’s staff can learn from peers who have done, say, a circular hotel renovation. Even site visits can be arranged (for example, touring a project that reused a lot of materials, guided by those who did it).

Each collaboration model has pros and cons, but importantly they are not mutually exclusive. Fyra could, for example, use a primary consultant (from the shortlist) *and* supplement with an academic advisor on a steering committee, *and* require that consultant to collaborate with a circular economy startup for certain deliverables.

## **Competence Development Opportunities**

If we identify a competence gap – say the circular aspect – one approach is to **train or certify Fyra’s own team** so they can handle parts of it directly or at least evaluate consultants better:

1. **Formal Certifications:** For circular economy in construction, there isn’t one global cert yet, but **Regenerative Design or Cradle-to-Cradle workshops** exist. For general sustainable building, **LEED AP O+M (Operations & Maintenance)** might be relevant for running a sustainable hotel, or **WELL AP** for healthy interiors (if that’s a focus). **Miljöbyggnad** certification training would help navigate Swedish certs. SGBC has a program for *Certifierad Miljöbyggsamordnare* which can be very useful[tyrens.se](https://www.tyrens.se/tjanster/haallbarhet/haallbart-byggande/#:~:text=H%C3%A5llbart%20byggande%20,en%20integrerad%20del%20i%20byggprocessen).  
2. **Courses and Programs:** There are YH (vocational university) programs for *Miljö- och hållbarhetssamordnare inom bygg*[jobb.frankgruppen.se](https://jobb.frankgruppen.se/jobs/6694164-miljo-och-hallbarhetskonsult#:~:text=Vi%20har%20ett%20brett%20tj%C3%A4nsteutbud,deklarationer%2C)[pwc.se](https://www.pwc.se/sv/karriar/jobba-med-hallbarhet.html#:~:text=Vilken%20v%C3%A4rld%20vill%20du%20l%C3%A4mna,v%C3%A4rld%20genom%20ett%20h%C3%A5llbart%20n%C3%A4ringsliv) – these are practical courses that someone at Fyra could attend (they cover climate calculations, etc.). Additionally, international programs like **Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Circular Economy courses** could broaden perspective (some are online).  
3. **Workshops with Consultants:** Many consulting firms (including some on our list like WSP, Sweco) offer client training as part of engagement. For example, at project kickoff they might do a sustainability workshop to align understanding. Fyra can insist on a *knowledge transfer* component in contracts – e.g. requiring documentation of processes or an end-of-project lessons learned session specifically to build Fyra’s internal guidelines.  
4. **Peer Networks:** As mentioned, **SGBC** and also **Green Building Councils in other Nordic countries** have working groups (like a Circularity forum). Fyra could participate. Also, groups like **Cradlenet** (a Swedish circular economy network) often host meet-ups regarding circular construction solutions.  
5. **Pilot Projects In-House:** If time allows, Fyra could do a small internal pilot – for example, redesign one hotel room using 100% reclaimed materials as a trial. This kind of hands-on mini-project (possibly with a university student or a hackathon) could give insight and confidence without huge risk.

All these steps reduce reliance on external help over time. They don’t remove the need for a consultant now, but mean Fyra can challenge consultants more and get better value (and perhaps eventually lead some initiatives themselves).

## **Validation and Data Verification**

In conducting this research, we adhered to the principle of cross-verifying critical information through at least two sources wherever possible[cirkulara.com](https://cirkulara.com/referenser/#:~:text=ombyggnadsprojekt%20av%20kontorshus%20fr%C3%A5n%2070,tex%20d%C3%B6rrar%2C%20glaspartier%20och%20luftkanaler)[cirkulara.com](https://cirkulara.com/referenser/#:~:text=Pr%C3%A4glat%20av%20samarbete). The data in this report comes primarily from **reputable, first-hand sources**: official company websites (for profiles and reference projects), press releases and news articles in industry media (for project details and quotes), and publications by recognized organizations (like SGBC, Boverket, etc. for context). For instance, claims about House of Choice being zero-energy were verified via White Arkitekter’s site[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=To%20meet%20our%20climate%20targets%2C,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy) *and* the developer Fabege’s release[fabege.se](https://www.fabege.se/en/vacant-premises/customer-case/house-of-choice/#:~:text=Scandinavia%E2%80%99s%20first%20zero). Likewise, Forsen’s hospitality project experience and CM leadership were confirmed in their own press release[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Forsen%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20oberoende%20projektledningsf%C3%B6retag,b%C3%A5de%20privata%20och%20offentliga%20kunder) and corroborated by news in *Byggindustrin*[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/framtidens-hotell-aer-haer-digitalt-och-personligt-1013966#:~:text=Framtidens%20hotell%20%C3%A4r%20h%C3%A4r%20,Vi%20jobbar%20vidare%20med).  
We took care to ensure information is up-to-date (circa 2024-2025). Where information was conflicting or unclear, we flagged it or chose the most recent credible source. For example, if AFRY’s website said one thing about a project and a news article said another, we cross-checked dates and context; typically the discrepancy was resolved by understanding that one source might describe scope during design, another after completion.  
A few areas had limited publicly available data – **for instance, specific cost rates** of consultants are not published, so our “Cost Level” assessments are based on anecdotal market knowledge and aligning known factors (like company size, typical contracts)[hifab.se](https://www.hifab.se/mfn_news/hifab-vinner-ytterligare-ett-stort-uppdrag-projekt-sky-city-office-sense-building/#:~:text=Hifab%20erbjuder%20projektledning%20och%20r%C3%A5dgivning,Certified%20Adviser%20%C3%A4r%20Remium%20AB)[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Forsen%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20oberoende%20projektledningsf%C3%B6retag,b%C3%A5de%20privata%20och%20offentliga%20kunder). We labeled these as estimates. Similarly, detailed performance metrics (like exact % reused materials achieved by each firm historically) were not always disclosed, so we relied on case studies where available (e.g. Vasakronan project by Cirkulära saved 180 MSEK and 3,800 tCO₂ by reuse[cirkulara.com](https://cirkulara.com/referenser/#:~:text=ombyggnadsprojekt%20av%20kontorshus%20fr%C3%A5n%2070,tex%20d%C3%B6rrar%2C%20glaspartier%20och%20luftkanaler)) to gauge capability.  
Each critical assertion—such as *“X company has done Y hotels”* or *“achieved Z% reuse”*—has been supported by references in the report. We aimed for at least two independent confirmations for very critical data (like regulatory compliance claims, major project achievements). In cases where only one source was found, we either used it with attribution or noted the uncertainty.  
If there are data points Fyra finds pivotal that remain unverified, those should be highlighted as areas for **direct inquiry in RFPs or interviews**. For example, none of the sources explicitly stated “Company ABC can integrate reused materials into contractor contracts effectively,” though Forsen implied it via CM and references. Fyra should ask such specific questions to the consultants directly, essentially using this report as a base to probe further.  
Overall, this research leveraged a combination of **primary sources (highest priority)**—company references, press releases, project databases—and **secondary sources** like trade journals and award citations[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/oct/14/skelleftea-swedish-plywood-eco-town-20-storey-wooden-skyscraper-worlds-tallest#:~:text=Isn%27t%20it%20good%2C%20Swedish%20plywood%3A,%E2%80%9CWhen%20I)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Awards%3A%20Tr%C3%A4priset%202024%2C%20Best%20Tall,Degerman%2C%20Sven%20Burman%2C%20David%20Valldeby) to ensure a robust, validated picture. We have clearly marked any speculative or inferred information as such. All in all, the information herein should be a reliable compass for Fyra to navigate the selection of a sustainability consultant/project leader in Sweden, buttressed by transparent citations for trustworthiness.
