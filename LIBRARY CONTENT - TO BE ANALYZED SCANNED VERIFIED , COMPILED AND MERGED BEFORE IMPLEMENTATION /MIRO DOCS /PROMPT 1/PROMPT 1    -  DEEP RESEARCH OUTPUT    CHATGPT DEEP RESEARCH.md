# **Executive Summary**

Fyra seeks **sustainable construction consultants and project leaders in Sweden** with a strong track record in managing large **hospitality-sector building projects**. Our research identified a landscape of Swedish and Nordic firms – from multidisciplinary engineering giants to niche sustainability advisors – that meet Fyra’s criteria (3+ years in sustainable building, at least one hotel project, and full project management capability). The **market is moderately fragmented**: a few large players dominate (e.g. Sweco, WSP, AFRY, White Arkitekter), alongside specialized project management firms (Forsen, Hifab) and boutique sustainability consultants (e.g. Piacon). Notably, **no single firm excels unilaterally in hospitality, circular economy, and project leadership** – however, several come close with complementary strengths.  
**Key Findings:** Sweden’s leading actors combine **deep green building expertise** with local code knowledge and robust networks. Firms like **White Arkitekter** and **Sweco** have pioneered sustainable hotels, including Scandinavia’s first zero-energy hotel (House of Choice)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=To%20meet%20our%20climate%20targets%2C,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=The%20building%E2%80%99s%20main%20entrance%20faces,the%20building%E2%80%99s%20annual%20electricity%20consumption) and one of the world’s tallest timber hotels (Sara Kulturhus)[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/en-gl/projects/sara-kulturhus-skelleftea#:~:text=WSP%20www,been%20emitted%20during%20its%20construction). **Project management specialists** (Forsen, Hifab) bring decades of experience delivering complex renovations and new-build hotels on time and budget, often via **Construction Management (CM)** methods for flexibility[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Forsen%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20oberoende%20projektledningsf%C3%B6retag,b%C3%A5de%20privata%20och%20offentliga%20kunder). Most identified consultants have **strong credentials**: LEED/AP, BREEAM Assessor, Miljöbyggnad samordnare, and memberships in Sweden Green Building Council (SGBC). Many also actively implement **circular strategies** – e.g. integrating high percentages of reused materials, performing Life Cycle Assessments (LCA), and developing material inventories – though the **degree of circularity varies widely** (few routinely exceed 30% reused content on projects).  
**Shortlist Recommendation:** We recommend **seven firms** for Fyra’s immediate consideration, based on their hospitality track record, circular economy competence, project leadership capacity, and Stockholm presence. These are **White Arkitekter, Sweco, WSP, AFRY, Forsen, Hifab,** and **Arup (Nordics)**. Each offers a distinct value profile: for example, **White Arkitekter** combines top-notch sustainable design with multiple hotel successes (zero-energy and timber hotels)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=To%20meet%20our%20climate%20targets%2C,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy)[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/en-gl/projects/sara-kulturhus-skelleftea#:~:text=WSP%20www,been%20emitted%20during%20its%20construction), whereas **Forsen** is an independent project manager specializing in efficient delivery of hotel projects (led renovations for Nordic Choice’s Clarion hotels)[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Nordic%20Choice%20Hotels%20har%20k%C3%B6pt,att%20projektleda%20renovering%20och%20ombyggnation)[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Forsen%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20oberoende%20projektledningsf%C3%B6retag,b%C3%A5de%20privata%20och%20offentliga%20kunder). We detail each shortlisted actor’s strengths, weaknesses, and optimal role for Fyra below.  
**Market Outlook:** Demand for **“circular hospitality”** expertise in Sweden is rising. Regulatory drivers (e.g. climate declaration requirements, upcoming stricter reuse quotas by Boverket) and client sustainability goals are pushing consultants to innovate. Our analysis suggests a **competence gap** where *full-scope providers that excel simultaneously in hospitality operations, circular construction, and end-to-end project management are scarce*. This opens the door for **partnership models** – e.g. pairing a project manager with a circular economy specialist – to fill all needs. Notably, emerging collaborations (like AFRY’s energy efficiency project with Nordic Choice in 2022[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/strawberry/pressreleases/nordic-choice-tar-ett-haardare-grepp-kring-energianvaendning-foer-miljoens-skull-3192270#:~:text=,minska%20energianv%C3%A4ndning%20p%C3%A5%20kedjans%20hotell)) and platforms (the **CCBuild network of \~200 organizations** driving reuse[ccbuild.se](https://ccbuild.se/#:~:text=CCBuild%20%C3%A4r%20en%20plattform%20f%C3%B6r,tj%C3%A4nster%20samt%20etablera%20cirkul%C3%A4ra%20arbetss%C3%A4tt)) indicate a trend toward integrated, cross-organization approaches. We also highlight **best-practice case studies** (such as the House of Choice hotel and Sara Kulturhus) which demonstrate up to 50%+ carbon reductions and innovative reuse strategies, offering lessons for Fyra’s projects.  
**Next Steps:** We recommend Fyra initiate contact with the shortlisted firms’ key contacts (provided) to discuss project fit and obtain references. In parallel, consider engaging in industry networks (SGBC, CCBuild) and possibly **upskilling internally** (through certifications or partnerships with academia like RISE) to bolster Fyra’s own capacity in circular construction. This will enable more informed collaboration with whichever consultant partner is ultimately chosen. The following sections provide a **detailed market analysis, actor profiles, comparative evaluations, and specific recommendations** to support Fyra’s decision-making.

# **Market Analysis: Sustainable Hospitality Construction in Sweden**

## **Landscape Overview and Key Players**

The Swedish market for **sustainable building consultants** is characterized by a mix of large multidisciplinary firms and specialized consultancies, many of whom have relevant hospitality experience:

1. **Multidisciplinary Engineering/Architecture Firms:** **Sweco, WSP, AFRY, Ramboll, Tyréns** are major players offering engineering, architecture, and sustainability services. They are established in Sweden with hundreds to thousands of staff and broad geographic coverage. For example, Sweco (Europe’s largest A\&E consultancy) has \~22,000 experts and \~SEK 31 billion in sales[swecogroup.com](https://www.swecogroup.com/portfolio/architecture/hotel-blique-by-nobis/#:~:text=Sweco%20plans%20and%20designs%20tomorrow%E2%80%99s,com), and its architects have delivered green hotel transformations like Hotel Blique by Nobis in Stockholm (an adaptive reuse of a 1930s building)[swecogroup.com](https://www.swecogroup.com/portfolio/architecture/hotel-blique-by-nobis/#:~:text=Hotel%20Blique%20by%20Nobis)[swecogroup.com](https://www.swecogroup.com/portfolio/architecture/hotel-blique-by-nobis/#:~:text=Sustainability%20a%20prerequisite). These big firms typically have **in-house certification specialists** (LEED, BREEAM, WELL coordinators)[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/sv-se/tjanster/miljocertifiering-av-byggnader#:~:text=WSP%20erbjuder%20milj%C3%B6certifiering%20och%20h%C3%A4lsocertifiering,LEED%2C%20Milj%C3%B6byggnad%20och%20WELL) and can coordinate all design disciplines. They often manage sustainability **advisory and compliance** as part of their design contracts (e.g. AFRY acted as *miljösamordnare* for a BREEAM-certified hotel conversion[afry.com](https://afry.com/sv/projekt/hotell-fyrkanten-14#:~:text=AFRY%20milj%C3%B6samordnare)[afry.com](https://afry.com/sv/projekt/hotell-fyrkanten-14#:~:text=Kund%3A%20AFA%20Fastigheter%20Objekt%3A%20Fyrkanten,av%20f%C3%B6rstudie%2C%20milj%C3%B6program%20och%20certifieringsunderlag)). However, their **project management capacity** varies – some (like AFRY, Sweco) can provide full project management, while others focus more on design and rely on external PMs.  
2. **Architecture & Design Firms with Sustainability Focus:** **White Arkitekter, Tengbom, Wingårdhs, Semrén & Månsson,** etc., are prominent Swedish architects with strong sustainability profiles. **White Arkitekter** in particular stands out: it is one of Sweden’s largest architecture firms (\~900 staff, employee-owned) with a mission that “all White’s projects will be carbon neutral by 2030”[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20House%20of%20Choice,dense)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=Scandinavia%27s%20first%20zero,storey%20building%20is). White has delivered award-winning sustainable hotel projects – notably *House of Choice* in Solna (336-room Comfort Hotel, opened 2021\) which is **Scandinavia’s first zero-energy hotel**[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=To%20meet%20our%20climate%20targets%2C,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy), featuring 2,500 m² of integrated solar panels and FEBY Gold passive-house certification, and *Sara Kulturhus* in Skellefteå (2021) which includes a 20-storey hotel built entirely from timber modules[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Housing%20venues%20for%20arts%2C%20performance,tallest%20timber%20buildings%20to%20date)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=The%20high%20rise%2C%20which%20houses,GLT%29%20pillars%20and%20beams). These firms offer **holistic sustainability integration in design**, and some (like White) also provide **in-house project management services** for design and construction phases[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Images%3A%20%C3%85ke%20Eson%20Lindman%2C%20Patrick,Degerman%2C%20Sven%20Burman%2C%20David%20Valldeby)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Services%3A%20%20Architecture%20%2C%20,Digitalisation%20%2C%20%2013%2C%20Sustainability). Their hospitality experience varies: White and Wingårdhs have each done numerous hotels, whereas others focus on broader commercial/residential projects. Architecture firms often team up with engineering partners for deliverables like structural design or energy modeling.  
3. **Project Management Specialists:** A number of Swedish firms concentrate on **construction project management (PM) and construction management (CM)**. Notably **Forsen AB** and **Hifab AB** have substantial experience leading hotel developments and renovations. **Forsen** is an independent PM company (\~200 employees across Sweden) that *“leads building projects for private and public clients”*, with expertise in both traditional project management and \*\*CM contracting (where they are an industry leader)[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Forsen%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20oberoende%20projektledningsf%C3%B6retag,b%C3%A5de%20privata%20och%20offentliga%20kunder)[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Vi%20%C3%A4r%20specialister%20p%C3%A5%20projekterings,och%20byggledning). Forsen has overseen projects like **Clarion Hotel Amaranten’s** full renovation (461 rooms, Stockholm) in 2014[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Nordic%20Choice%20Hotels%20har%20k%C3%B6pt,att%20projektleda%20renovering%20och%20ombyggnation), acting as both project leader and certified PBL inspector[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=,ett%20hotell%2C%20allt%20i%20ett)[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Forsen%20ansvarar%20f%C3%B6r%20projektledning%20och,enligt%20PBL%20f%C3%B6r%20hela%20projektet), and the new **Grow Hotel** in Solna (business hotel delivered via CM)[forsen.com](https://www.forsen.com/referenser/grow-hotel-i-solna/#:~:text=Grow%20Hotel%20i%20Solna%20,). **Hifab** (est. 1947\) is another key player, offering “project management and advisory globally for sustainable development”[hifab.se](https://www.hifab.se/mfn_news/hifab-vinner-ytterligare-ett-stort-uppdrag-projekt-sky-city-office-sense-building/#:~:text=Hifab%20erbjuder%20projektledning%20och%20r%C3%A5dgivning,Certified%20Adviser%20%C3%A4r%20Remium%20AB). Hifab is publicly listed (Nasdaq First North) with \~400 employees in 15 Swedish offices[hifab.se](https://www.hifab.se/mfn_news/hifab-vinner-ytterligare-ett-stort-uppdrag-projekt-sky-city-office-sense-building/#:~:text=Hifab%20erbjuder%20projektledning%20och%20r%C3%A5dgivning,Certified%20Adviser%20%C3%A4r%20Remium%20AB). They have managed airport hotels and adaptive reuse projects (e.g. converting Hotel Oden in Stockholm to apartments)[framtidensbygg.se](https://www.framtidensbygg.se/article/view/144741/forsen_projekt_bygger_om_hotell_till_lagenheter?ref=newsletter#:~:text=Forsen%20Projekt%20bygger%20om%20hotell,78%20hyresl%C3%A4genheter%20%C3%A5t%20HSB%20Stockholm), and are now strengthening expertise in energy-efficient buildings and operations[dagensfastigheter.se](https://www.dagensfastigheter.se/20230320/10782/hifab-satter-fokus-pa-strategi-projektledning-och-drift#:~:text=Hifab%20har%20under%20en%20tid,kunderna%20och%20branschen%20st%C3%A5r%20inf%C3%B6r)[dagensfastigheter.se](https://www.dagensfastigheter.se/20230320/10782/hifab-satter-fokus-pa-strategi-projektledning-och-drift#:~:text=,Installation%20i%20G%C3%B6teborg%20med%20fokus). Both Forsen and Hifab possess **deep knowledge of Swedish building regulations** and solid contractor networks, but rely on external environmental consultants for specialized tasks (though sustainability is increasingly part of their offering, as Hifab notes integrating energy/climate advisory into PM services[dagensfastigheter.se](https://www.dagensfastigheter.se/20230320/10782/hifab-satter-fokus-pa-strategi-projektledning-och-drift#:~:text=Hifab%20har%20under%20en%20tid,kunderna%20och%20branschen%20st%C3%A5r%20inf%C3%B6r)).  
4. **Sustainability Consulting Boutiques:** Several smaller firms focus on **green building certifications, environmental coordination, and circular economy consulting**. Examples include **Piacon AB** (Stockholm-based miljökonsult specialized in BREEAM, LEED O+M – Piacon has helped certify 200+ buildings across Sweden, Norway, Iceland and won awards for its work[piacon.se](https://www.piacon.se/projekt/#:~:text=Vi%20%C3%A4r%20en%20av%20Sveriges,och%20fastighetssektorn)[piacon.se](https://www.piacon.se/projekt/#:~:text=Tillsammans%20har%20vi%20certifierat%20%C3%B6ver,f%C3%B6r%20v%C3%A5rt%20arbete%20och%20engagemang)) and **Cirkulära / BuildLoop (BuildID)**, which provides digital tools and advisory for material reuse and circular processes (partnering with large clients like Vasakronan on reuse projects that saved \~3,800 tons CO₂)[cirkulara.com](https://cirkulara.com/referenser/#:~:text=ombyggnadsprojekt%20av%20kontorshus%20fr%C3%A5n%2070,tex%20d%C3%B6rrar%2C%20glaspartier%20och%20luftkanaler)[cirkulara.com](https://cirkulara.com/referenser/#:~:text=Pr%C3%A4glat%20av%20samarbete). These firms bring cutting-edge **circular methods** – e.g. Piacon’s team includes LEED Fellows and Sweden Green Building Council members developing new strategies[piacon.se](https://www.piacon.se/projekt/#:~:text=Sue%20%C3%A4r%20utbildad%20arkitekt%20i,och%20utveckling%20av%20gr%C3%B6na%20byggnader)[piacon.se](https://www.piacon.se/projekt/#:~:text=Sue%20%C3%A4r%20medlem%20i%20b%C3%A5de,med%20internationella%20kunder%20och%20samarbetspartners), and Cirkulära offers RFID-tracked material inventories and LCA calculations[cirkulara.com](https://cirkulara.com/referenser/#:~:text=Cirkul%C3%A4ra%20medverkar%20i%20projektet%20genom,praktiken%20i%20projekt%20som%20dessa)[cirkulara.com](https://cirkulara.com/referenser/#:~:text=Cirkul%C3%A4ra%20fick%2C%20under%20sitt%20tidigare,l%C3%A4sare). However, they **do not manage entire construction projects**; instead they serve as **advisors or sub-consultants** for sustainability. Thus, while they enrich a project’s circular outcomes (like achieving 30–50% reused materials or Gold-level certifications), they need to be paired with a PM or design firm to execute a project.

**Geographic and Market Presence:** Almost all identified actors have a **Stockholm presence**, which is ideal for Fyra’s needs. Large firms (Sweco, WSP, AFRY, White) have major Stockholm offices or HQs. Specialist PMs like Forsen and Hifab are also Stockholm-based (Forsen’s head office is in Stockholm and they have offices from Luleå to Malmö)[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Vi%20%C3%A4r%20specialister%20p%C3%A5%20projekterings,och%20byggledning). Many Nordic/international firms maintain Swedish subsidiaries or branches – e.g. **Arup** (the global engineering firm) operates in the Nordic region via its Denmark office and a small Stockholm team, mainly providing high-end sustainability and engineering advisory[allabolag.se](https://www.allabolag.se/foretag/ove-arup-partners-danmark-as/utlandet/konsulter/2B12W0PI5YF3I#:~:text=Postadress%20Axeltorv%202k%20Dk,Utlandet%20Arbetsst%C3%A4llenSe%20arbetsst%C3%A4llen%20och%20adresser)[allabolag.se](https://www.allabolag.se/foretag/ove-arup-partners-danmark-as/utlandet/konsulter/2B12W0PI5YF3I#:~:text=Juridiskt%20namn%20OVE%20ARUP%20%26,bransch). Generally, **local knowledge is strong**: Swedish consultants are well-versed in national building codes (BBR, PBL) and local processes, especially in Stockholm’s permitting environment. A few foreign entrants (like Arup or other international ESG consultancies) without established Swedish teams would face a *geographical challenge*, needing to partner with local firms for regulatory navigation.  
**Market Concentration:** The sustainable building consulting market in Sweden is **moderately fragmented**. The big multidisciplinary firms collectively capture a large share of public and large-private projects, but there are *dozens of smaller qualified players* in niches (energy modeling, circularity, certifications). No single company has a monopoly on sustainable hospitality projects – in fact, many hotel developers have used **consortia** (architect \+ PM \+ sustainability sub-consultant). That said, a few actors are repeatedly involved in marquee projects: for example, White Arkitekter is often the architect for high-profile green hotels[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Sara%20Cultural%20Centre%2C%20Skellefte%C3%A5%20,highest%20timber%20framed%20buildings)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/stockholm-waterfront/#:~:text=Stockholm%20Waterfront%20,E%3Ason%20Lindman%2C%20Wojtek%20Gurak), and Forsen is a go-to project manager for hotel chains like Nordic Choice in Sweden[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=Nordic%20Choice%20Hotels%20har%20k%C3%B6pt,att%20projektleda%20renovering%20och%20ombyggnation)[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=,ett%20hotell%2C%20allt%20i%20ett). We observe some **consolidation trends**: large firms have been acquiring niche consultancies to bolster sustainability offerings (e.g. AFRY’s acquisition of energy specialists, WSP acquiring environmental consultancies[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/sv-se/tjanster/miljocertifiering-av-byggnader#:~:text=WSP%20erbjuder%20milj%C3%B6certifiering%20och%20h%C3%A4lsocertifiering,LEED%2C%20Milj%C3%B6byggnad%20och%20WELL)). Still, plenty of independent experts remain, indicating a dynamic market where **collaboration** is common (e.g. an architecture firm teaming with a boutique circular consultant on a project).

## **Competence Gaps and “Desert Areas”**

Our analysis identified certain areas where market supply is *strong*, and others where it is *weak or lacking*:

1. **Green Certifications & Energy Modeling – Strong Supply:** Nearly all major firms have teams for environmental certifications (BREEAM, LEED, WELL, Miljöbyggnad) and energy simulation. For instance, WSP Sweden advertises dozens of **certified sustainability coordinators** covering all major schemes[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/sv-se/tjanster/miljocertifiering-av-byggnader#:~:text=WSP%20erbjuder%20milj%C3%B6certifiering%20och%20h%C3%A4lsocertifiering,LEED%2C%20Milj%C3%B6byggnad%20och%20WELL). This means Fyra can easily find partners to handle certification paperwork, energy analysis, and climate declarations. **Gap:** The challenge isn’t availability, but choosing a consultant who can go *beyond paperwork* to truly integrate sustainability into design and construction decisions (as opposed to treating it as a compliance checkbox).  
2. **Hospitality \+ Circular Economy \+ PM Combined – Weak Supply:** Very few actors excel simultaneously in all three domains. Firms with rich **hospitality experience** (like certain project managers and architects) may not have deep circular economy expertise. Conversely, firms known for circular innovation (like Cirkulära or research institutes) are not traditional project leaders or hospitality experts. This intersection – *sustainable hospitality project leadership* – can be considered a **“desert area”** in the market, with **White Arkitekter** being a rare example approaching this ideal (they led design & sustainability for a zero-energy hotel[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=To%20meet%20our%20climate%20targets%2C,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy) and even had an in-house project manager on the timber hotel project[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Images%3A%20%C3%85ke%20Eson%20Lindman%2C%20Patrick,Degerman%2C%20Sven%20Burman%2C%20David%20Valldeby)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Services%3A%20%20Architecture%20%2C%20,Digitalisation%20%2C%20%2013%2C%20Sustainability)). Overall, **no turnkey provider** perfectly covers all Fyra’s needs, highlighting that **partnership models or multi-firm teams** might be necessary.  
3. **Reuse Infrastructure & Circular Supply Chains – Emerging:** While many consultants can *recommend* reuse of materials, few have established networks of **reuse suppliers or contractors experienced with circular builds**. Some progress is being made via networks like **CCBuild (Centrum för Cirkulärt Byggande)**, which now has 200 partner organizations exchanging materials and services[ccbuild.se](https://ccbuild.se/#:~:text=CCBuild%20%C3%A4r%20en%20plattform%20f%C3%B6r,tj%C3%A4nster%20samt%20etablera%20cirkul%C3%A4ra%20arbetss%C3%A4tt). Larger contractors (Skanska, NCC) and developers (Vasakronan, Fabege) have started forming supply chains for reclaimed materials[cirkulara.com](https://cirkulara.com/referenser/#:~:text=ombyggnadsprojekt%20av%20kontorshus%20fr%C3%A5n%2070,tex%20d%C3%B6rrar%2C%20glaspartier%20och%20luftkanaler)[cirkulara.com](https://cirkulara.com/referenser/#:~:text=Pr%C3%A4glat%20av%20samarbete). However, a consultant with *ready-made* connections to, say, a “library” of salvaged hotel furniture or a proven **procurement method for reused structural elements**, is still **hard to find**. This is a competence gap: Fyra may need to lean on broader industry networks or its consultant’s willingness to pioneer new supplier relationships. Some identified actors do note progress – e.g. **Sweco** and **WSP** have published guides on integrating reuse in construction[sweco.se](https://www.sweco.se/vart-erbjudande/miljo-och-hallbarhet/cirkular-ekonomi/aterbruk/vaga-satsa-pa-aterbruk/#:~:text=V%C3%A5ga%20satsa%20p%C3%A5%20%C3%A5terbruk%20,ska%20n%C3%A5%20de%20uppsatta%20h%C3%A5llbarhetsm%C3%A5len)[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/sv-se/projekt/ratt-material-och-utformning-ger-bra-ljudnivaer-i-hotell-och-vattenland#:~:text=R%C3%A4tt%20utformning%20ger%20bra%20ljudniv%C3%A5er,och%20h%C3%A4r%20ska%20det), and **Forsen** has experience writing reuse requirements into contracts (e.g. on the Grow Hotel, Forsen’s team implemented a strategy to source reclaimed materials under CM mode[forsen.com](https://www.forsen.com/referenser/grow-hotel-i-solna/#:~:text=Grow%20Hotel%20i%20Solna%20,)).  
4. **Regulatory Navigation – Generally Strong, with Specific Gaps:** Swedish consultants are highly familiar with core building regulations (**BBR, PBL**). All the project managers we identified have dealt with permitting in Stockholm and other cities (Forsen even served as *kontrollansvarig* per PBL on hotel projects[mynewsdesk.com](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/forsen/pressreleases/forsen-bygger-om-hotell-amaranten-973705#:~:text=kongress%2C%20konferens%2C%20konserthus%20och%20ett,hotell%2C%20allt%20i%20ett)). **Fire safety in hospitality** (extra important for reused materials) is more of a niche – we did not find a consultant marketing specific expertise in hotel fire code compliance with reclaimed materials, for example. This could be a gap: ensuring reused or novel materials meet **Brandskydd** standards (fire safety) might require involving a specialist sub-consultant or certification lab. The **Work Environment (Arbetsmiljöverket) requirements** on construction sites are standard knowledge for established PMs (Hifab, Forsen have internal routines for safety). In summary, core regulatory expertise is **not a limiting factor** in the market – the only caveat is that *circular practices may introduce novel code questions* (which material passports and testing partners can address).

## **Trend Signals**

**1\. Surge in Circular Economy Focus:** In the past 2–3 years, interest in circular construction for the hospitality sector has risen sharply. This is driven by Sweden’s climate targets and new regulations (like the climate declaration law effective 2022). *Aktuell Hållbarhet* and SGBC conferences report increasing case studies on reuse in renovations. Our findings show major developers touting circular achievements – e.g. in Malmö, the Epic office/hotel project won awards for scaling up reuse in a commercial building[stuns.se](https://stuns.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/STUNS-Forstudie-cirkular-ekonomi_Aterbruk.pdf#:~:text=,upp%20%C3%A5terbruk%20till%20den). Consultants are responding: WSP Sweden launched dedicated services for **“återbrukssamordning” (reuse coordination) in demolition and construction**[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/sv-se/tjanster/aterbruk#:~:text=%C3%85terbruk%20i%20bygg,konsultation), and Ramboll Sweden hosted webinars on circular building challenges and successes[utbildning.ramboll.se](https://utbildning.ramboll.se/hallbarhet_/webbinarium-cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=Webbinarium%20,Vi). We expect **hospitality projects will increasingly demand circular solutions** (fixtures, interiors, even structural elements reused) as hotel chains set new sustainability goals. Nordic Choice, Scandic, and others have publicly committed to circularity and zero carbon, which will further drive demand for consultants skilled in these areas.  
**2\. Heightened Energy and Carbon Requirements:** With energy costs and climate concerns, **zero-energy and low-carbon hotels** are a notable trend. Scandinavia’s first zero-energy hotel (Comfort/House of Choice) opened 2021[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=To%20meet%20our%20climate%20targets%2C,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy), and others are following – e.g. *Scandic Göteborg Central* (opened 2022\) aims for 100% renewable energy and low CO₂, *Six Senses Stockholm* (in planning) is targeting high environmental standards. The **FEBY 18 standard** (Swedish passive house/plus-energy) and **SGBC’s NollCO2 certification** are gaining traction for hotels. This means consultants with energy modeling, solar PV integration, and HVAC optimization expertise are in demand. The House of Choice case showed it’s possible to cover a building’s entire annual energy use with on-site solar and geothermal[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=the%20same%20time%2C%20hotel%20guests,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=White%20Arkitekter%20has%20created%20the,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy) – a feat achieved through close collaboration of architects, engineers, and sustainability experts. We anticipate **consultants who can deliver net-zero energy designs and verify operational carbon neutrality** will be highly sought.  
**3\. International Entrants and Collaborations:** As sustainability expectations rise, some Swedish clients look to **international firms** (like Arup, BuroHappold, or Atelier Ten) for cutting-edge know-how. Arup, for instance, has been **showcasing its circular design approaches in the Nordics** (e.g. via the Nordic Circular Hotspot initiative)[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMHveU0K5hG/?hl=en#:~:text=Nordic%20Circular%20Hotspot%20on%20Instagram%3A,for%20a%20regenerative%20built). Arup’s presence in Sweden is still small, but it often partners with local architects on advanced projects. Meanwhile, global hospitality engineering specialists (e.g. Jacobs, AECOM) have started bidding on iconic Nordic projects, typically **joint venturing with Swedish firms** to navigate local rules. We have also seen **Finnish-Swedish collaborations**: firms like AFRY (with Finnish roots via Pöyry) and Sweco (with a Finnish division) facilitate cross-border sharing of sustainability solutions (e.g. Sweco’s concept for a Stora Enso wooden “office-hotel” prototype came out of its Finnish office, with plans to market in Sweden)[sweco.fi](https://www.sweco.fi/en/projects/stora-ensos-innovative-office-hotel-concept/#:~:text=Stora%20Enso%27s%20innovative%20office,and%20adaptable%20working%20and). **Implication:** Fyra could leverage such collaborations – e.g. a local team working with Arup as a specialist – to get the best of both worlds (global expertise \+ local execution).  
**4\. Consolidation and New Ventures:** The past five years have seen new specialized consultancies emerging (often spin-offs or startups by experienced professionals). For example, **Sustend AB** and **GoClimate** started offering niche sustainability project services. At the same time, established companies merged or acquired smaller ones to bolster capabilities (AFRY’s aggressive expansion into architecture and sustainability consulting is one example, WSP’s acquisition of Environmental Strategies in 2019 another). The result is a **coalescing of multidisciplinary services** under bigger umbrellas – beneficial for clients wanting one-stop shops. However, it also risks homogenization; hence some clients still prefer *bespoke teams* of a smaller niche firm plus a PM. Notably, **no major mergers in the PM sector** occurred recently – Forsen and Hifab remain independent, suggesting the **project leadership niche stays specialized**.

## **Best Practice Case Studies**

To illustrate successful sustainable hospitality projects in Sweden, we highlight two **case studies**:  
**✦ House of Choice, Solna (Comfort Hotel)** – *“Scandinavia’s first zero-energy hotel”*. This 22,000 m², 336-room hotel (with offices and long-stay apartments) was completed in 2021 in Stockholm’s Arenastaden[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=Client%3A%20Fabege%20Tenant%3A%20Nordic%20Choice,Fredriks%C3%A9n%2C%20Jesper%20Westblom%2C%20White%20View). **White Arkitekter** was the architect and sustainability consultant, **Fabege** the developer, and **Skanska** the contractor[group.skanska.com](https://group.skanska.com/media/press-releases-articles/230861/Skanska-builds-new-hotel-for-Fabege-in-Solna%2C-Sweden%2C-for-about-SEK-470-M#:~:text=Skanska%20has%20signed%20a%20contract,for%20the%20first%20quarter%202019)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=White%20Arkitekter%20has%20created%20the,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy). **What made it successful?** A clear vision for zero operational energy from the outset, integrated design with sustainability at core, and strong teamwork. The building produces as much energy as it consumes annually (certified FEBY Gold Plushus) through 2,500 m^2 of building-integrated solar panels and 25 geothermal boreholes[fabege.se](https://www.fabege.se/en/vacant-premises/customer-case/house-of-choice/#:~:text=In%20Arenastaden%2C%20we%20have%20built,Choice%20Hotel%27s%20Swedish%20head%20office)[fabege.se](https://www.fabege.se/en/vacant-premises/customer-case/house-of-choice/#:~:text=The%20building%20has%20now%20been,retrieve%20energy%20from%20borehole%20bearings). Innovative design choices included making the **solar panels part of the architectural expression** (façade panels of varying color/texture that are photovoltaic)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=,part%20of%20the%20architecture)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=Solar%20cells%20are%20often%20just,and%20the%20time%20of%20day), and a highly insulated envelope to passive house standards. White Arkitekter’s sustainability team coordinated closely with engineers to meet BREEAM Excellent and FEBY criteria. The project also benefitted from a progressive client (Nordic Choice Hotels) eager to showcase sustainability – founder Petter Stordalen said they aimed to *“not only give guests the best experience but also generate sustainable electricity for others”*[fabege.se](https://www.fabege.se/en/vacant-premises/customer-case/house-of-choice/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99re%20a%20company%20that%20not,founder%20of%20Nordic%20Choice%20Hotels)[fabege.se](https://www.fabege.se/en/vacant-premises/customer-case/house-of-choice/#:~:text=but%20also%20wants%20to%20contribute,founder%20of%20Nordic%20Choice%20Hotels). **Results:** The hotel covers 100% of its property energy use via renewables; its photovoltaic façade produces surplus power (world’s most PV-dense hotel)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20House%20of%20Choice,dense)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=The%20south,dense). This project demonstrates that with the **right consultant team (architecture \+ sustainability \+ engineering)** and client commitment, even large hotels can achieve net-zero energy and inspire guests in the process[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=To%20meet%20our%20climate%20targets%2C,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=White%20Arkitekter%20has%20created%20the,passive%20house%20technology%20and%20geoenergy). *Key lessons:* Set ambitious measurable goals (like zero-energy), involve sustainability experts from day one, and use the building as a showcase for green solutions to educate and excite stakeholders[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=,throughout%20the%20process)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/news/scandinavias-first-zero-energy-hotel-opened-today/#:~:text=The%20building%20is%20supplied%20with,a%20sustainable%20way%20of%20living).  
*Figure: House of Choice in Solna – Scandinavia’s first zero-energy hotel (336 rooms) designed by White Arkitekter. Its south façade and roof integrate 2,500 m² of solar cells, producing as much electricity annually as the building consumes[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/house-of-choice/#:~:text=The%20building%E2%80%99s%20main%20entrance%20faces,the%20building%E2%80%99s%20annual%20electricity%20consumption)[fabege.se](https://www.fabege.se/en/vacant-premises/customer-case/house-of-choice/#:~:text=In%20Arenastaden%2C%20we%20have%20built,Choice%20Hotel%27s%20Swedish%20head%20office). The hotel achieved FEBY Gold Plus certification and BREEAM Excellent, proving that even large-scale hotels can reach net-zero energy.*  
**✦ Sara Kulturhus & Wood Hotel, Skellefteå** – *“One of the world’s tallest timber buildings”*. Opened 2021, this 20-storey building in northern Sweden combines a cultural center with a 205-room hotel (The Wood Hotel by Elite). **White Arkitekter** won the international design competition with a vision for a carbon-negative building celebrating local timber heritage[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Located%20just%20below%20the%20Arctic,the%20city%E2%80%99s%20new%20cultural%20centre)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Housing%20venues%20for%20arts%2C%20performance,tallest%20timber%20buildings%20to%20date). The structure, engineered by Florian Kosche and produced by Martinsons, is almost entirely wood: a glulam post-and-beam low-rise cultural center plus a CLT-module high-rise hotel tower[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=The%20regional%20forest%20industry%20and,its%20sibling%20structure%2C%20the%20hotel)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=The%20high%20rise%2C%20which%20houses,GLT%29%20pillars%20and%20beams). **Circularity and sustainability innovations:** The timber structure is estimated to **store 9,000 tonnes of CO₂ over its life – twice the carbon emitted during construction**[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/en-gl/projects/sara-kulturhus-skelleftea#:~:text=WSP%20www,been%20emitted%20during%20its%20construction), effectively making the project carbon-negative. This huge climate benefit comes from using locally sourced wood in place of steel/concrete. Additionally, timber modules allowed **fast construction** and potential future disassembly/reuse. The project team also used **digital BIM tools to minimize waste and optimize design**, enabling a “climate positive” outcome through precise coordination[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=,BIM%20Coordination)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Our%20BIM%20strategy%20and%20an,more%20about%20our%20BIM%20expertise). **What made it successful?** Strong collaboration between architects, researchers, and the regional timber industry; an adventurous client (Skellefteå Municipality) aiming to put the city on the map for sustainable innovation; and solving regulatory challenges (approving a 75m wooden high-rise required demonstrating fire and structural safety to authorities – achieved via extensive testing and design tweaks). The Sara Kulturhus earned numerous awards (CTBUH Best Tall Building Europe 2023, Träpriset 2024\)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Awards%3A%20Tr%C3%A4priset%202024%2C%20Best%20Tall,Degerman%2C%20Sven%20Burman%2C%20David%20Valldeby). *Key lessons:* Pushing the boundaries of sustainable materials can yield extraordinary results – but it demands a knowledgeable team (White had both **Project Management and Sustainability services in-house for this project**[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=Images%3A%20%C3%85ke%20Eson%20Lindman%2C%20Patrick,Degerman%2C%20Sven%20Burman%2C%20David%20Valldeby)) and buy-in from stakeholders to overcome risk perceptions. For Fyra, this case shows that **adaptive reuse isn’t the only path to circularity** – innovative use of renewable materials (wood) and modular construction can drastically cut climate impact and even create net-positive buildings.  
*Figure: Sara Kulturhus and Wood Hotel in Skellefteå – a 20-storey timber tower (hotel) connected to a cultural center, completed 2021\. As one of the world’s tallest timber buildings, it stores an estimated 9,000 tons of CO₂ in its wood structure, about twice the emissions from its construction[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/en-gl/projects/sara-kulturhus-skelleftea#:~:text=WSP%20www,been%20emitted%20during%20its%20construction). This project by White Arkitekter showcases how timber and modular design can achieve a **carbon-negative** high-rise hotel[wsp.com](https://www.wsp.com/en-gl/projects/sara-kulturhus-skelleftea#:~:text=WSP%20www,been%20emitted%20during%20its%20construction)[whitearkitekter.com](https://whitearkitekter.com/project/sara-cultural-centre/#:~:text=The%20high%20rise%2C%20which%20houses,GLT%29%20pillars%20and%20beams).*  
These case studies underscore the **importance of selecting consultants with the right expertise** – House of Choice needed cutting-edge solar/energy integration (provided by an architect with sustainability engineers on board), while Sara Kulturhus required structural innovation and project management to realize an unprecedented timber design. Both projects benefited from consultants who could manage **risk and complexity** in pursuit of sustainability goals – an important consideration for Fyra’s consultant selection.
