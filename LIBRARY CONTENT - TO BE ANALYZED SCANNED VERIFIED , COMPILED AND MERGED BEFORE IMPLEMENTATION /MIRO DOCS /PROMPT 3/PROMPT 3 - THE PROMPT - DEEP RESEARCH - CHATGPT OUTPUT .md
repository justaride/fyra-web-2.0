# **Executive Summary**

Regulatory Landscape: Sweden’s regulations impacting circular economy in building projects are comprehensive and evolving. The national Building Code (Boverkets Byggregler, BBR) applies equally stringent technical requirements to renovations as to new builds

, covering fire safety, structural integrity, energy performance, and indoor environment. Key environmental laws like the Miljöbalken embed sustainability principles (precaution, knowledge, product choice, and resource cycles) that all construction projects must heed

. At the same time, waste regulations mandate sorting of construction and demolition debris into at least six fractions (wood, mineral, metal, glass, plastic, gypsum)

[lagen.nu](https://lagen.nu/2020:614#:~:text=Image%3A%20,varandra%20och%20fr%C3%A5n%20annat%20avfall)

 and set ambitious recycling targets (70% recovery of C\&D waste) aligned with EU goals. Chemical safety rules (e.g. REACH) and work environment laws impose strict duties to survey and safely handle hazardous materials like asbestos and PCBs in older buildings, and even reused materials must comply with current chemical restrictions

[cirkularitet.se](https://cirkularitet.se/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Snabbfakta_Kemikalier-och-%C3%A5terbruk-av-m%C3%B6bler.pdf#:~:text=Att%20s%C3%A4lja%20en%20gammal%20m%C3%B6bel,Detta%20inneb%C3%A4r%20att%20dessa)

. Building permits under the Plan- och bygglagen (PBL) are generally required for significant alterations but not for minor interior refurbishments (those may only need a notification/startbesked). Protected historic buildings trigger *varsamhetskrav* (carefulness requirements) under PBL, balancing preservation with upgrades. In sum, formally Sweden has a robust regulatory framework ensuring that reuse and circular practices do not compromise safety or environmental standards, though this can create practical hurdles for using salvaged materials. Enforcement and Practice: In practice, enforcement of these regulations varies. The current national government has signaled a focus on deregulation and efficiency, pushing to simplify building permit rules by 2025

[arkitekten.se](https://arkitekten.se/nyheter/regeringen-vill-genomfora-massiv-forandring-av-bygglovsreglerna/#:~:text=Regeringen%20vill%20genomf%C3%B6ra%20massiv%20f%C3%B6r%C3%A4ndring,kommunerna%20hanterar%20med%20%C3%B6ver)

 and cautioning against overly burdensome climate measures. This has translated into moderate enforcement of newer sustainability requirements – for example, the climate declaration (carbon footprint report) now required for new buildings is overseen by Boverket, but so far enforcement focuses on compliance assistance rather than penalties

[boverket.se](https://www.boverket.se/sv/klimatdeklaration/om-klimatdeklaration/tillsyn/#:~:text=Boverket%20har%20tillsyn%20av%20klimatdeklarationens,i%20deklarationen%20%C3%A4r%20riktiga)

. Traditional safety rules (fire, structural, health) are still rigorously enforced by local building officials and fire authorities, especially in the hospitality sector where guest safety is paramount. However, industry feedback suggests that rules can be inconsistently applied: some municipalities (like Gothenburg and Malmö) proactively encourage circular practices (even requiring reuse in city projects

), whereas smaller communes may lack resources or know-how, leading to a more conservative “business as usual” approach. Insurance companies often impose stricter demands on hotels than the law – for instance, requiring documentation that all furniture meets fire standards, with non-compliance potentially affecting coverage. On the whole, while Swedish law provides avenues to use reclaimed materials (e.g. allowing performance verification in lieu of CE-marking for reused products

[boverket.se](https://www.boverket.se/sv/byggande/cirkular-ekonomi/styrmedel/ce-markning-och-aterbruk/#:~:text=Nytillverkade%20byggprodukter%20ska%20i%20m%C3%A5nga,egenskaper%20verifieras%20p%C3%A5%20annat%20s%C3%A4tt)

), the *default mindset* is still cautious. Successful circular projects navigate this by early and thorough compliance planning, engaging authorities proactively to find acceptable solutions. Key Challenges and Risks: Several risk areas have been identified for circular hotel projects. A top concern is fire safety classification of reused interior elements – many vintage furnishings lack modern certification, posing a *Medium-High likelihood* risk of non-compliance that could halt a project (impact *High*). Mitigation includes early fire testing (at least 4+ months before install) and having backup materials or flame-proofing treatments in case

[firesafe.se](https://www.firesafe.se/service/brandskydd-i-hotellverksamhet-bb-och-annan-form-av-uthyrning-av-boende/#:~:text=Kontroll%20av%20brandcellsgr%C3%A4nser)

. Hazardous substances in older materials present a *High impact* risk if not caught – for example, discovery of asbestos (still found in pre-1982 buildings) can stop work immediately. The law requires an asbestos survey for any renovation of older buildings

[faringsotra.se](https://www.faringsotra.se/asbest-i-hus/#:~:text=Asbest%20i%20hus%20%E2%80%93%20Vad,att%20en%20asbestkartl%C3%A4ggning%20m%C3%A5ste%20g%C3%B6ras)

, so diligent testing and sourcing from known post-2000 materials (or obtaining safety datasheets for legacy items) keeps this risk Low. Regulatory delays (e.g. building permit or heritage approvals) are a moderate likelihood risk that can affect timelines; early engagement with the local byggnadsnämnd and building in schedule buffers (4–6 weeks) are effective mitigations. Another challenge is documentation: many reuse suppliers are small and may not provide the paperwork needed (fire ratings, chemical content, etc.), so Fyra must set clear contract requirements and be prepared to do third-party testing or use “equivalent” documentation like material inventories or lab reports. Finally, the policy environment itself poses some uncertainty – while drastic changes are *low likelihood* in the short term, shifting political priorities or upcoming EU directives could tighten or relax requirements in the coming 2–5 years. The strategy is to stay agile and informed (through industry networks and newsletters) so the company can anticipate and adapt to new rules (for instance, upcoming carbon limit values in 2027 or digital product passports). Opportunities: On the positive side, Sweden’s regulatory trend is moving toward recognizing and facilitating circular economy, even if slowly. Municipal initiatives in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö are creating more “pull” for reuse (with pilot projects, internal circular guidelines, and even dedicated reuse marketplaces

). There is also growing acceptance in the private sector – major hotel chains like Scandic publicly state they prioritize recycled materials in renovations

[scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/sv/hallbarhet/vision-och-strategi/sleep/#:~:text=Sleep%20,samband%20med%20byggnation%20och%20renovering)

, and the national Public Procurement Authority encourages life-cycle cost and durability criteria in projects

. This momentum means that despite the compliance workload, there is support available (guidelines from Boverket, industry certification systems, etc.) and a PR upside for early adopters of circular practices. With a robust compliance strategy (detailed in this report), Fyra can successfully navigate Sweden’s rules and even leverage them as a quality assurance mechanism that sets the firm apart. The following sections map out the detailed regulations and practical guidance to achieve that.

# **Detailed Regulatory Framework in Sweden**

## **Building Code Requirements (Boverkets Byggregler – BBR)**

General applicability: Sweden’s building code (BBR) contains mandatory performance requirements for health, safety, and environmental performance of buildings. Crucially, these technical requirements apply not only to new construction but also to *renovations and alterations*. The baseline principle is that *“samma kravnivå gäller vid ändring av byggnad som vid uppförande av nya byggnader”* – the same level of requirements for alterations as for new builds

[boverket.se](https://www.boverket.se/sv/PBL-kunskapsbanken/regler-om-byggande/boverkets-konstruktionsregler/overgripande-bestammelser/krav-vid-andring/#:~:text=Utg%C3%A5ngspunkten%20%C3%A4r%20att%20samma%20kravniv%C3%A5,kan%20%C3%A4ven%20%C3%A4ldre%20verifieringsmodeller%20anv%C3%A4ndas)

. In other words, using reclaimed materials does not exempt a project from meeting modern standards. BBR does allow some adaptation of requirements for existing buildings if strict compliance is technically or economically unreasonable, but the room for deviation is small and must be justified

[boverket.se](https://www.boverket.se/sv/PBL-kunskapsbanken/regler-om-byggande/boverkets-konstruktionsregler/overgripande-bestammelser/krav-vid-andring/#:~:text=och%20kontroll%20i%20till%C3%A4mpliga%20delar,s%C3%A5dana%20avsteg%20%C3%A4r%20dock%20litet)

. Therefore, any reused component must be assessed against current code demands in the relevant area (fire, structural, energy, etc.), or an alternative compliance method must be approved. Health and Environment (Hygien, hälsa och miljö): BBR Chapter 3 and Chapter 9 address indoor environment, moisture, and material health aspects. All materials in a building – including reused ones – must not pose health hazards. This ties into Miljöbalken’s *produktvalsprincip* (product choice principle) which demands avoiding materials dangerous to health or environment if alternatives exist

[naturvardsverket.se](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/vagledning-och-stod/miljobalken/hansynsreglerna--kapitel-2-miljobalken/#:~:text=Produktvalsprincipen%20%282%20kap,ers%C3%A4ttas%20med%20mindre%20farliga%20alternativ)

. In practice, this means any salvaged items should be vetted for substances like lead, asbestos, formaldehyde, or flame retardants that are now banned or restricted. If an older material contains a now-prohibited substance (for example PCB in sealants or certain brominated flame retardants in upholstery), it cannot legally be reused unless it is remediated. Chapter 9 also covers moisture and mold – reused structural elements or finish materials must be free of mold or rot and suitable for the damp conditions they’ll be placed in. Documentation such as Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) or lab test results may be needed to prove a reclaimed product meets the Chapter 3:4 requirements on not emitting pollutants or Chapter 6 sound/vibration standards, etc. Essentially, from a health perspective, reused materials are treated like new: they must be “fit for use” and not introduce any hygiene or environmental risk into the building. Fire Safety (Brandskydd): BBR’s fire protection rules (Chapter 5 in earlier BBR versions) have critical implications for hospitality projects. Hotels are classified as *verksamhetsklass 4* (occupancy type 4\) in the fire code, reflecting that they house sleeping occupants who are not familiar with the building

[firesafe.se](https://www.firesafe.se/service/brandskydd-i-hotellverksamhet-bb-och-annan-form-av-uthyrning-av-boende/#:~:text=Kontroll%20av%20brandcellsgr%C3%A4nser)

. This leads to strict requirements:

* Fire compartments: Each hotel guest room must be its own fire cell separated by fire-resistant construction (typically EI 60 walls/floors)  
* [orust.se](https://www.orust.se/download/18.1c4985fe183bfdb97a246f/1665396582851/L%C3%A4mplig%20brandskyddsniv%C3%A5%20f%C3%B6r%20hotell%20eller%20liknande%20verksamhet%20enligt%20R%C3%A4ddningstj%C3%A4nsten.pdf#:~:text=L%C3%A4gsta%20sk%C3%A4lig%20niv%C3%A5%20p%C3%A5%20befintliga,krav%20st%C3%A4llts%20p%C3%A5%20d%C3%B6rrst%C3%A4ngare%20enligt)  
* . Room doors must be self-closing and fire-rated (at least EI 30\)  
* [orust.se](https://www.orust.se/download/18.1c4985fe183bfdb97a246f/1665396582851/L%C3%A4mplig%20brandskyddsniv%C3%A5%20f%C3%B6r%20hotell%20eller%20liknande%20verksamhet%20enligt%20R%C3%A4ddningstj%C3%A4nsten.pdf#:~:text=L%C3%A4gsta%20sk%C3%A4lig%20niv%C3%A5%20p%C3%A5%20befintliga,krav%20st%C3%A4llts%20p%C3%A5%20d%C3%B6rrst%C3%A4ngare%20enligt)  
* . Reusing a door or partition wall is possible only if it has documented fire resistance performance (original test certificates or a new fire test). Otherwise, one should plan to upgrade it (e.g. add fireboard) or replace it.  
* Escape routes: Hotels must have at least two independent escape routes from every floor  
* [orust.se](https://www.orust.se/download/18.1c4985fe183bfdb97a246f/1665396582851/L%C3%A4mplig%20brandskyddsniv%C3%A5%20f%C3%B6r%20hotell%20eller%20liknande%20verksamhet%20enligt%20R%C3%A4ddningstj%C3%A4nsten.pdf#:~:text=Krav%20Boverkets%20byggregler%20kap,tv%C3%A5%20av%20varandra%20oberoende%20utrymningsv%C3%A4gar)  
* . Corridors serving as escape routes form their own fire compartment and must use non-combustible or low-flame-spread materials  
* [firesafe.se](https://www.firesafe.se/service/brandskydd-i-hotellverksamhet-bb-och-annan-form-av-uthyrning-av-boende/#:~:text=Kontroll%20av%20brandcellsgr%C3%A4nser)  
* . The Euroclass system is used – typically interior surface finishes in exits need to be class B-s1,d0 (which corresponds to former Swedish “Class I” surface). This means that if Fyra wants to reuse wall paneling or ceiling materials in a corridor, they must either inherently meet B-s1,d0 or be treated to achieve it. Any furniture or decor placed in escape route areas also faces restrictions; heavy combustible load in an escape corridor may trigger requirements like automatic smoke alarms or sprinklers  
* [orust.se](https://www.orust.se/download/18.1c4985fe183bfdb97a246f/1665396582851/L%C3%A4mplig%20brandskyddsniv%C3%A5%20f%C3%B6r%20hotell%20eller%20liknande%20verksamhet%20enligt%20R%C3%A4ddningstj%C3%A4nsten.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Om%20utrymningsv%C3%A4g%20ej%20uppfyller,Larmet%20skall%20utl%C3%B6sas%20automatiskt%20av)  
* . In general, smoke production and flammability of furnishings in hotels are tightly controlled to ensure safe egress.  
* Smoke control and furnishings: Upholstered furniture and textiles in hotels are usually required (by practice or insurer demands) to pass fire spread tests (EN 1021-1/2 for cigarette and match flame). BBR itself doesn’t mandate specific furniture tests, but it does require that interior materials do not contribute rapidly to fire growth. This effectively forces use of flame-retardant fabrics and foam in public areas. Thus, reused sofas, curtains, etc. should have a fire rating certificate or be treated with flame retardants to meet at least the same standard as new hotel furniture. For example, many hotel operators require furniture to comply with Swedish standard SRV 140 or EN 1021\. If a salvaged piece lacks documentation, Fyra should budget for fire testing at a lab or application of a fire-proofing spray and documentation of its efficacy.  
* Fire detection and suppression: While BBR does not explicitly mandate sprinklers in hotels of low height, many hotels install them due to risk considerations or insurer requirements. All hotels must have automatic fire alarms. Reuse doesn’t directly affect this, but if the project involves reusing an old HVAC or ceiling system, ensure integration of detectors/sprinkler heads isn’t impeded. Emergency lighting and exit signs must meet current standards (often when refurbishing, these need upgrading – reused signs likely won’t comply unless relatively new and approved).

In summary, fire safety is often the hardest hurdle for circular interior design. It is recommended to involve a fire consultant early. BBR allows performance-based solutions, so a consultant can help justify reused elements via fire engineering analysis or additional protections. Still, expect that any unknown material must be tested or assumed to have the lowest fire performance (and thus likely excluded)

[firesafe.se](https://www.firesafe.se/service/brandskydd-i-hotellverksamhet-bb-och-annan-form-av-uthyrning-av-boende/#:~:text=Kontroll%20av%20brandcellsgr%C3%A4nser)

. This is a critical compliance checkpoint before finalizing design. Structural Safety and Reuse of Load-Bearing Elements: If the project involves reusing structural components (e.g. salvaged beams or floorboards), BBR Chapter 8 and the eurocodes apply. Structural elements must have verified capacity for loads per modern standards. Boverket has issued guidance that while new load-bearing products must be CE-marked, it’s usually not feasible to CE-mark used ones – instead their properties should be verified by testing or calculation

[boverket.se](https://www.boverket.se/sv/byggande/cirkular-ekonomi/styrmedel/ce-markning-och-aterbruk/#:~:text=Nytillverkade%20byggprodukter%20ska%20i%20m%C3%A5nga,egenskaper%20verifieras%20p%C3%A5%20annat%20s%C3%A4tt)

. For example, a reclaimed glulam beam could be assessed by an engineer who inspects for cracks, takes samples if needed, and calculates load capacity with safety factors. The reuse of structural members triggers the need for a Kontrollplan (inspection plan) item to check those members specifically during construction. It’s also worth noting BBR’s durability requirements: old materials may be more brittle or have decay, so ensure any structural reuse meets the safety margins for the intended design life. Chapter 8 also includes *Safety in use* (Säkerhet vid användning) – think of things like balustrades, stairs, glass – reused items for these applications must meet current code (e.g. glass must be safety glass if in a location subject to human impact, old railings might need height adjustments to 1.1m, etc.). Energy Efficiency (Energihushållning): BBR Chapter 9 sets stringent energy performance requirements for new buildings (maximum allowed kWh/m² per year, U-values, etc.). For existing buildings under renovation, the law says to improve energy performance to the extent “reasonable.” In practice, if a renovation is major (“ombyggnad”), authorities often expect significant energy upgrades (insulation, better windows, efficient HVAC) unless it’s disproportional or a heritage building. Using reused components can impact energy compliance in two ways:

* *Insulation & envelope:* If Fyra considers reusing old windows or doors for aesthetic reasons, be aware that their thermal performance may be worse than modern units. This could make meeting the energy quota difficult. One solution is to install secondary glazing or accept a slightly higher energy use if allowable. Sweden does permit some leeway in energy requirements for renovations, but this must be negotiated. If a building is culturally valuable, sometimes energy rules are relaxed to preserve original windows – otherwise, adding interior storm windows (possibly reused ones) can help balance preservation with efficiency.  
* *Klimatdeklaration:* Since 2022, all new buildings in Sweden require a Climate Declaration (a life-cycle carbon report) at completion. Currently, this is informational only (no max limit yet)  
* [byggindustrin.se](https://www.byggindustrin.se/om/klimatdeklaration/#:~:text=klimatdeklaration%20,11%20juni%202020%2C%2007%3A00)  
* . For renovations, it’s not mandatory *yet*, but by 2027 the government plans to extend climate reporting or even introduce CO₂ limits for more project types  
* [boverket.se](https://www.boverket.se/sv/klimatdeklaration/om-klimatdeklaration/nyheter/nytt-regeringsuppdrag-till-boverket-om-gransvarden-for-byggnaders-klimatpaverkan/#:~:text=,i%20kraft%20senast%20januari)  
* [byggkoll.byggtjanst.se](https://byggkoll.byggtjanst.se/artiklar/2023/maj/forslag-pa-gransvarden-for-nya-byggnader/#:~:text=Fr%C3%A5n%20den%201%20januari%202027,fr%C3%A5n%20byggnadens%20livscykel%20som)  
* . Reusing materials generally improves the carbon footprint, which is a good story to tell. Fyra should document the carbon savings from reuse – even if not legally required for a refurb, it can be used in discussions with authorities or clients to demonstrate alignment with climate goals.

Accessibility and “Väsentlig ändring”: An important trigger in BBR/PBL is if a renovation is so extensive that it counts as a “väsentlig ändring” (substantial alteration) or “ombyggnad”. If so, modern code requirements for accessibility (Chapter 3 and PBL 8:2) kick in for the affected areas. For a hotel, this could mean that during a major renovation you might need to add accessible rooms or upgrade door widths, ramps, etc., even if you are just redoing interiors. This is not directly about reuse, but it’s a compliance area to watch – e.g., reusing an old bar counter is great, but if it’s too high to meet today’s accessibility standards, it must be modified or an alternate provided. Generally, if the renovation costs exceed 25% of building value or affects a significant portion, authorities may classify it as ombyggnad, making the project subject to full current standards as far as “reasonably achievable.” Fyra should seek early guidance from the building officials on how they interpret this threshold. Sometimes a project can be split into phases to avoid triggering full compliance at once. Heritage Buildings: Many boutique hotels reside in historic buildings. Swedish law (PBL 8 chap.) has cultural environment provisions that override some building code demands in favor of preservation. If a structure is a byggnadsminne (listed building) or deemed of “special architectural or cultural value,” any alteration must be done carefully (*varsamhet*) and not distort the character (PBL 8:17). In practical terms, this can allow exemptions from certain BBR rules – for example, one might retain original wooden windows (less energy-efficient) to preserve the façade, or not install sprinkler heads in a decorative ceiling if it would ruin it (maybe use alternative fire measures). However, such exceptions require case-by-case approval. The balance between preservation and climate/safety is delicate: authorities will look for solutions that improve sustainability *without* irreversibly harming cultural value. Dispensation (lovbefrielse) can be granted by the local building committee for specific requirements if strict compliance conflicts with heritage protection – an example is waiving accessibility retrofits in an old building where it’s structurally implausible. Any hotel project in a heritage building should engage a conservation expert and consult the municipality’s culture department early to map out what is or isn’t allowed. Often, reuse and restoration go hand-in-hand here (using original materials is encouraged), but adding *new* reused elements from elsewhere might be subject to design review to ensure they match historically. Documentation and Approvals: Under PBL and BBR, documentation is a cornerstone of compliance:

* Bygglov & anmälan: Generally, an interior renovation that doesn’t change the building’s external appearance or its use (still a hotel) may not require a full building permit, but it does require an anmälan (notification) if it involves changes to structural elements, fire safety systems, plumbing, or significant plan layout changes. For instance, moving walls, altering escape routes, or changing the number of guest rooms likely triggers an *anmälan* and a new startbesked (start clearance) from the building committee  
* [boverket.se](https://www.boverket.se/sv/PBL-kunskapsbanken/lov--byggande/anmalningsplikt/byggnader/annat/#:~:text=Krav%20p%C3%A5%20anm%C3%A4lan,exempelvis%20handla%20om%20%C3%A4ndring)  
* . Minor refreshes (surface changes) typically are maintenance and need no permit. However, if the hotel is in a protected building or area, even interior changes can need approval. Each municipality can interpret thresholds slightly differently – Stockholm tends to require anmälan for most non-trivial interior remodels in public buildings, whereas a small municipality might be more lenient. Lead times for bygglov in big cities can be 8–12 weeks or more, so plan accordingly. Stockholm Stad for example has a backlog, so early submission and possibly hiring a local consultant to expedite is wise.  
* Kontrollansvarig & Kontrollplan: Any project that is anmälningspliktig will need a Kontrollplan (inspection plan) and likely a certified Kontrollansvarig (KA) person to sign off that critical inspections are done. The Kontrollplan will list verifications – expect to include checking that all reused materials critical to safety have proper documentation or test results. For example, if reusing a glass partition, the Kontrollplan might require checking it is safety glass. Fyra should prepare those docs for the final besiktning (inspection). The building cannot be taken into use until the municipality issues a slutbesked (final clearance), which they will only do once all requirements in the Kontrollplan are fulfilled and e.g. fire department has approved the premises.  
* Product documentation: Sweden has voluntary systems like Byggvarudeklaration (BVD) – an environmental product declaration specific to building materials. Many clients request BVDs or similar for all products. For reused items, Fyra may need to create a custom BVD-like document stating what the product is, its composition (if known), origin, any hazardous content, and recommendations for future recycling. This becomes part of the project handover documentation (drift- och skötselpärm).  
* CE Marking & DoP: The EU Construction Products Regulation (CPR) requires that any new construction product covered by a harmonized standard must be CE-marked and accompanied by a Declaration of Performance. Used products generally do not have a new CE mark – if they were originally installed before CE marking was around (pre-90s), they never had one. Boverket acknowledges it’s rarely possible to CE mark a used product and allows “other verification”

* . For practicality, retain any original stamps or labels on reclaimed items (e.g. a steel beam with grade markings or an old fire door’s rating plate). If none, have an engineer certify the performance. Lack of CE marking in itself is not a legal barrier if the building official is satisfied the product meets the functional requirements. An important nuance: electrical and gas appliances do have CE marking under other directives – if reusing commercial kitchen equipment or similar, ensure they still have their CE labels and are safe. All in all, document everything to make the official comfortable that “all requirements are met”.

In conclusion, the formal rules demand that reused components achieve equivalence to new ones in safety, health, and performance. Compliance can be achieved by a combination of original documentation, new testing, engineering assessments, and occasionally dispensations. Fyra’s design team should incorporate regulatory checkpoints (e.g. fire engineer review, building official pre-consultation) to ensure the creative reuse ideas are grounded in what’s approvable.

## **Environmental Law and Waste Regulations (Miljöbalken & Avfallsförordningen)**

Sweden’s Miljöbalk (Environmental Code) provides the overarching principles that influence how materials and waste are handled in construction:

* General Duty of Care: Miljöbalken Chapter 2 lays out allmänna hänsynsregler (general consideration rules) that apply to everyone. Key principles include the Precautionary Principle (take preventive measures as soon as there is a suspicion of risk)  
* [naturvardsverket.se](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/vagledning-och-stod/miljobalken/hansynsreglerna--kapitel-2-miljobalken/#:~:text=F%C3%B6rsiktighetsprincipen%20%282%20kap,f%C3%B6r%20milj%C3%B6%20eller%20h%C3%A4lsa%20uppst%C3%A5r)  
* , the Knowledge Requirement (ensure you have sufficient knowledge about the materials and methods you use to protect health and environment)  
* [naturvardsverket.se](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/vagledning-och-stod/miljobalken/hansynsreglerna--kapitel-2-miljobalken/#:~:text=Kunskapskravet%20%282%20kap,ol%C3%A4genheter%20f%C3%B6r%20m%C3%A4nniskor%20och%20milj%C3%B6)  
* , and the Product Choice Principle (*Produktvalsprincipen*) which requires avoiding hazardous substances or products if less dangerous alternatives are available  
* [naturvardsverket.se](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/vagledning-och-stod/miljobalken/hansynsreglerna--kapitel-2-miljobalken/#:~:text=Produktvalsprincipen%20%282%20kap,ers%C3%A4ttas%20med%20mindre%20farliga%20alternativ)  
* . For Fyra’s projects, this means due diligence is expected: for example, if reusing an old armchair, the team should have knowledge of its foam and fabric content – is it free of banned flame retardants? If not sure, the precautionary approach would be to test it or choose a different item. These principles aren’t just abstract; they are enforceable by environmental inspectors. In renovations, especially if there are complaints or inspections, authorities can ask to see that you evaluated potential environmental hazards.  
* Resource Management (Kretsloppsprincipen): Notably, Chapter 2 §5 of Miljöbalken is the “kretsloppsprincipen” – requiring anyone conducting an activity to conserve raw materials and minimize waste, by reusing and recycling whenever possible  
* [naturvardsverket.se](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/vagledning-och-stod/miljobalken/hansynsreglerna--kapitel-2-miljobalken/#:~:text=Kretsloppsprincipen%20%282%20kap,annat%20genom%20%C3%A5teranv%C3%A4ndning%20eller%20%C3%A5tervinning)  
* . This principle essentially enshrines the circular economy in law. While there’s no specific fine for not reusing materials, it supports any authority’s decision that expects you to handle materials responsibly. For example, simply throwing functional fixtures in a dumpster would violate the spirit of this principle – instead, one should attempt to sell or donate them. In fact, the PBL’s portal paragraph echoes this, stating land, water, energy, and raw materials shall be managed prudently for long-term good environmental conditions  
* [fastighetsagarna.se](https://www.fastighetsagarna.se/globalassets/rapporter/fran-sveriges-webb/riv-hinder-for-aterbruk_forslag-for-hallbart-resursanvandade.pdf?bustCache=1759676101287#:~:text=skapa%20en%20ny%20praxis,I%20punkt%209%20anges)  
* . Thus, one can argue (and some have) that approving reused materials in a building *aligns* with these legal duties – a helpful point if needing to convince an official to allow a deviation for the sake of reuse  
* [fastighetsagarna.se](https://www.fastighetsagarna.se/globalassets/rapporter/fran-sveriges-webb/riv-hinder-for-aterbruk_forslag-for-hallbart-resursanvandade.pdf?bustCache=1759676101287#:~:text=hush%C3%A5llning%20med%20mark%2C%20vatten%2C%20energi,om%20hush%C3%A5llning%20av%20%E2%80%9Cr%C3%A5varor%E2%80%9D%20eller)  
* .

Waste or Not Waste – The Legal Definitions: Miljöbalken Chapter 15 and the Avfallsförordningen (Waste Ordinance 2020:614) govern how construction waste must be handled:

* When is a used material “waste”? According to the law, anything you intend to discard is waste. If during a renovation, a door is removed and set aside *with the intention to reuse it either on-site or in another project*, it might not be considered waste at all, but rather a product under storage. However, the line is fine – if that door ends up with an external recycling firm or you’re unsure of its fate, authorities could classify it as waste until it has a clear reuse destination. Sweden has been exploring “end-of-waste” criteria, but currently there is no blanket end-of-waste rule for generic construction materials (unlike for for example metal scrap or glass cullet which EU has criteria for). Practically, to keep materials out of the waste category (and thus avoid waste bureaucracy), one should handle them carefully and document that they are intended for reuse (e.g. inventory them, perhaps sell them as products). If something is declared waste, then only a certified waste management company can handle it in many cases.  
* Sorting and Recycling Requirements: For any waste that *is* generated, Sweden’s ordinance requires strict sorting. Construction and demolition waste must be sorted on-site into at least wood, concrete/brick (mineral), metal, glass, plastic, and gypsum fractions, kept separate from each other  
* [lagen.nu](https://lagen.nu/2020:614#:~:text=Image%3A%20,varandra%20och%20fr%C3%A5n%20annat%20avfall)  
* . Additionally, all hazardous waste (e.g. lead paint debris, mercury bulbs, etc.) must be separated and handled by licensed facilities. The sorting rule has been in force since 2020 and municipalities do inspect construction sites for compliance. A hotel renovation must plan space for multiple dumpsters or containers. Given the emphasis on reuse, ideally a lot of material will go to reuse rather than waste, but inevitably some will be waste (e.g. broken tiles, scrap). There is also a national target of 70% material recovery of C\&D waste  
* [sverigesmiljomal.se](https://sverigesmiljomal.se/etappmalen/okad-resurshallning-i-byggsektorn/#:~:text=%C3%96kad%20resursh%C3%A5llning%20i%20byggsektorn%20,och)  
* . As of 2020 Sweden was at \~53%  
* [fastighetstidningen.se](https://fastighetstidningen.se/nyhet/avfallsmangderna-har-okat/#:~:text=Avfallsm%C3%A4ngderna%20har%20%C3%B6kat%20,Motsvarande)  
* , so efforts are underway to increase recycling. While this 70% is a policy goal (no direct fine if a single project doesn’t hit it), companies are encouraged to improve. On a project level, some municipalities might ask in the building application how you intend to manage waste – it’s good to mention a high rate of reuse/recycling to align with these goals.  
* Landfill bans: Sweden has banned landfilling of sorted combustible waste and organic waste since the early 2000s  
* [lagen.nu](https://lagen.nu/2020:614#:~:text=Image%3A%20,om%20deponering%20av%20avfall)  
* . This means practically all construction waste will either be recycled or burned for energy, not dumped. For Fyra, the implication is any wood, textiles, plastic that aren’t reused will likely go to incineration – which is better than landfill, but still not as good as reuse. Also, landfill is costly; disposing of materials in Sweden carries high fees, so there is financial incentive to find someone who will take materials for reuse.  
* “Producer Responsibility” for certain products: Sweden has extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws for a number of product categories – notably electronic equipment, batteries, packaging, and (recently) textiles. Starting 2024, a new EPR for textiles requires producers/importers of clothing and home textiles to finance collection and recycling of textile waste  
* [avfallsverige.se](https://www.avfallsverige.se/aktuellt/nyheter/producentansvar-pa-textil-glommer-bort-kommunerna/#:~:text=Sverige%20www,ska%20vara%20%E2%80%9Dl%C3%A4mplig%E2%80%9D%20och)  
* . For hotels, this means old linens, curtains, carpets could be taken back through these schemes instead of landfilled. Furniture is another area: while not yet under formal EPR in Sweden, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan is pushing for it, and countries like France and (soon) some others have furniture EPR. Many furniture manufacturers in Sweden have voluntary take-back programs (e.g. office furniture companies refurbish and resell used pieces). When renovating hotel furniture, Fyra can check if the original manufacturer offers a take-back; this could ease the waste burden (and align with the ordinance’s requirement to prefer reuse). Also, mattresses are a significant waste item in hospitality – there is talk of producer responsibility for mattresses coming. Staying aware of these schemes is important because they can provide free or subsidized recycling.  
* Waste Handling Responsibilities: Under Miljöbalken, the byggherre (developer) carries responsibility to ensure waste is handled legally. This means Fyra (or the client, depending on contract) must use licensed transporters for waste and report hazardous waste to the national waste registry. The Avfallsförordning requires that if you send waste to someone, that person/facility must have the proper permit. For example, giving scrap metal to a scrap dealer is fine (they’re permitted), but handing old chemically treated wood to a friend to burn would be illegal. All disposal or recycling must be documented (receipts, waste manifests). At project’s end, usually a summary of waste quantities (tonnage per fraction) is provided as part of the final environmental report.

Hazardous materials (Asbest, PCB, etc.): The renovation of any building from the 20th century in Sweden must consider legacy hazardous substances:

* Asbestos: As noted, Swedish law explicitly requires an asbestos inventory before any renovation work in a building built (or with technical installations) pre-1982  
* [faringsotra.se](https://www.faringsotra.se/asbest-i-hus/#:~:text=Asbest%20i%20hus%20%E2%80%93%20Vad,att%20en%20asbestkartl%C3%A4ggning%20m%C3%A5ste%20g%C3%B6ras)  
* . This falls under Arbetsmiljöverket regulations (because it’s about worker safety primarily) and the Work Environment Act. A certified inspector must sample suspect materials (old floor tiles, pipe insulation, ventilation seals, etc.). If asbestos is found, a licensed asbestos abatement firm must do the removal prior to general demolition. For a hotel, asbestos could be in old vinyl flooring, insulation on old boilers, fireproofing above ceilings, etc. The presence of asbestos can significantly affect timeline and cost, so this risk should be evaluated early (and costs passed to client as necessary). Not conducting an asbestos survey is not an option – it’s both illegal and extremely dangerous. The good news is that once dealt with, the site can be declared asbestos-safe. PCB: Sweden had extensive use of PCBs in building materials (sealants, paints) up to the late 1970s. There was a mandate to remove PCB-containing sealants by 2016 for all affected buildings. Still, during demolition, if PCB is encountered (e.g. around window frames or in floor coatings), it must be handled by specialists. Many municipalities request a *PCB inventory* as well for buildings from 1950–1973 if not done before. So, part of regulatory compliance is ensuring all toxic legacies are cleared – it aligns with Miljöbalken’s precaution and also with waste rules (these materials count as hazardous waste).  
* REACH and chemical compliance for reused products: The EU REACH regulation applies to chemicals in products. A perhaps surprising fact is that selling a *used* item does not exempt one from REACH obligations. If Fyra supplies a used product as part of the project (say, installs salvaged light fixtures or furniture), legally the company is a “supplier of an article” under REACH. This means if that article contains any Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) above 0.1% weight, Fyra must inform the client about it  
* [cirkularitet.se](https://cirkularitet.se/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Snabbfakta_Kemikalier-och-%C3%A5terbruk-av-m%C3%B6bler.pdf#:~:text=f%C3%B6rord%02ningens%20kandidatlista%20tv%C3%A5%20g%C3%A5nger%20per,att%20de%20kan%20komma%20att)  
* . The European Chemicals Agency keeps a list of SVHC (e.g. certain phthalates, flame retardants, heavy metals). For new products, manufacturers usually provide this info. For old products, Fyra will need to do some detective work. For instance, many 1970s foam cushions contained pentaBDE (a now-banned flame retardant, also a POP). If one were to reuse such a chair, that substance is not only an SVHC but is actually outright banned for sale under the POPs regulation. In practical terms, Fyra should avoid reused materials that likely contain toxic chemicals. Prioritize materials from recent decades where regulations were stricter, or get a lab to test materials if unsure. Swedish authorities have also implemented a chemical tax on new electronics and will do so for textiles – not directly on reuse, but it shows the trend. It’s a selling point to clients that reused furnishings avoid new chemicals and often off-gassing. But due diligence is key to ensure you’re not inadvertently reintroducing hazardous substances.

Site Pollution and Soil: While not directly about building reuse, note that if the project involves site work (say installing new ground-source heat pumps or an extension), the Miljöbalk has rules about contaminated soil. The property owner must investigate and remediate polluted soil encountered. This is more relevant if doing an addition to a hotel on an old industrial site. Just be aware that circular economy includes not spreading contamination – any dug-up contaminated soil must be handled as hazardous waste appropriately. In summary, Sweden’s environmental and waste regulations strongly encourage circular practices (reuse is explicitly promoted) while strictly controlling any harmful aspects. Fyra’s compliance approach should mirror the waste hierarchy: *Prevent waste first, then reuse, then recycle, energy recover, and landfill last resort*. Documenting that approach will satisfy both Miljöbalken’s principles and the practical waste ordinances.

## **Work Environment and Safety Regulations (Arbetsmiljölagen, AML)**

Any construction or renovation in Sweden falls under strict worker safety laws. The Work Environment Act (AML) and associated Arbetsmiljöverket regulations impose duties on the employer (and building contractor) to ensure a safe worksite, which intersects with circular economy in several ways:

* Handling of Used Materials on Site: Using reclaimed components can pose unconventional risks – for example, old pieces might have jagged edges, unknown paint contents, or simply be heavier/different shape than new. The site safety plan needs to account for this. Employers must perform a risk assessment for all tasks. If workers are cleaning old bricks, is there silica dust exposure? If cutting old steel, could there be lead paint fumes? These need mitigating measures (dust masks, ventilation, etc.). Arbetsmiljöverket can do site inspections and will expect that hazards of old materials (like potential chemical exposure or extra manual lifting due to irregular items) are addressed. Providing proper PPE and training is mandatory. There’s no explicit regulation saying “used materials are dangerous” – it falls under general duty to assess risks.  
* Asbestos and Hazardous Substance Work: This overlaps with Miljöbalken but from the worker safety angle: only certified workers can remove asbestos or certain hazardous materials. If reused materials are coming from a demolition, ensure the demolition contractor followed all safety rules in removing them. When Fyra installs reused items, if there’s any modification (like cutting an old board that has lead paint), that task must be done with precautions as per the applicable AFS (Arbetsmiljöverkets Föreskrifter). For example, AFS 2014:43 on hazardous dust would require special procedures if disturbing old paint or insulation.  
* Construction Noise, Vibration, Etc.: Renovating hotels often happens on a tight schedule, sometimes even while parts of the building remain operational. Ensure compliance with rules on noise exposure for workers and not exposing hotel staff or guests to hazards (which introduces liability concerns). Coordinate isolation of work areas – Swedish sites are quite strict on segregating work zones and signage.  
* Employer vs. Supplier Responsibility: If Fyra is the interior design firm, it may not be the main contractor. But whoever is “Byggherre” and “BAS-U” (safety coordinator) on site has legal responsibility. It’s crucial to clarify roles in contracts. If Fyra directly supplies reclaimed items, it carries responsibility that those items are safe to handle (free of nails, not coated in toxic dust, etc.). Communicate with contractors about any special handling needed for reused elements.  
* Training: Arbetsmiljöverket expects that workers have relevant training for the tasks. If using novel reused products, perhaps brief the crew on any differences (e.g. “These reused tiles are thicker and heavier, lift carefully” or “This salvaged timber has pre-drilled holes – watch out for snapping”). It sounds minor, but safety culture in Sweden is strong; any accident traced back to an “unknown” property of a reused material could attract scrutiny.  
* Working at Heights / Scaffolding, etc.: Not specific to reuse, but ensure any deconstruction work (like carefully removing antique interior features) uses proper access equipment. Sometimes workers take risks to salvage something delicate – but law-wise, safety comes first. It might be safer to sacrifice a piece than have a worker climb unsafely to get it.

In essence, circular construction must also be safe construction. A good practice is to include in the project’s work environment plan a section on handling reused materials. Arbetsmiljöverket doesn’t have special rules against reuse; they just don’t want anyone hurt or exposed to danger because of it.

## **Public Procurement and Circularity (LOU – Law on Public Procurement)**

While many hotel projects are private, understanding public procurement rules is useful, as they often set the tone for sustainability requirements and larger trends: Sweden’s public procurement law (LOU) allows and even encourages contracting authorities to include sustainability and innovation criteria. Recent policy emphasizes using procurement as a tool for circular economy

[riksrevisionen.se](https://www.riksrevisionen.se/granskningar/granskningsrapporter/2022/miljomassig-hallbarhet-vid-statlig-upphandling---pa-ratt-vag-men-langt-kvar.html#:~:text=,om%20till%20en%20cirkul%C3%A4r%20ekonomi)

. For instance, Upphandlingsmyndigheten (Procurement Authority) has issued guidance on circular procurement

[upphandlingsmyndigheten.se](https://www.upphandlingsmyndigheten.se/om-hallbar-upphandling/miljomassigt-hallbar-upphandling/upphandling-for-att-framja-cirkular-ekonomi/#:~:text=Cirkul%C3%A4r%20ekonomi%20kan%20fr%C3%A4mjas%20genom,genom%20strategiskt%20ink%C3%B6psarbete%20och)

. In practice, what does this mean?

* Environmental and social criteria: In a tender for a government-funded building, you might see requirements like *“X% of materials by value shall be reused or recycled”* or *“Furniture must be certified by Möbelfakta or equivalent”*. Public clients can also require take-back services (e.g. the supplier must take back packaging or old equipment). These criteria can serve as inspiration for private projects. For example, a hotel chain not bound by LOU might still voluntarily adopt similar criteria for their internal procurement – especially international brands who have ESG goals.  
* Life Cycle Cost (LCC) evaluation: Instead of lowest bid, many procurements use LCC, meaning they consider operating costs, maintenance, and end-of-life. A circular approach often shines in LCC because more durable, reusable solutions have lower costs long-term. Public tenders have started to include LCC for evaluating flooring, for example, giving an edge if you propose a floor that can be refurbished instead of replaced. Fyra can use LCC arguments with clients (even if private) to justify perhaps a higher upfront cost for reclaimed high-quality materials that will last.  
* Innovation partnerships: LOU provides mechanisms for innovation procurement, where the procurer and suppliers work together to develop new solutions (e.g. pre-commercial procurement). While a hotel project likely wouldn’t undergo that, the general push means that municipalities and agencies are interested in pilot projects for circular building – which could present funding or partnership opportunities (for instance, Stockholm’s internal circular building center or Gothenburg’s “Handslag” initiative). If Fyra wants to pilot a particularly novel approach (say a hotel with 100% reclaimed interior), seeking a public-private collaboration could provide support or at least smoother approvals.  
* Implications for Fyra: If Fyra ever works on a publicly financed hotel or a PPP project, be prepared for formal requirements: use of certain ecolabeled materials, documentation of recycled content, etc. Private developers often piggyback on established criteria sets – e.g. JVs with municipalities might require adherence to Miljöbyggnad Silver rating or similar (which has material and waste points).

Notably, an October 2025 report by Trä- och Möbelföretagen (TMF) calls for changes in LOU to weight quality and circularity higher, and recommends requiring longer lifespan and reuse in public tenders

[tn.se](https://www.tn.se/hallbarhet/41275/ny-rapport-offentlig-upphandling-maste-bli-mer-cirkular/#:~:text=Rapporten%20S%C3%A5%20sluts%20cirkeln%20beskriver,och%20h%C3%A5llbarhet%20ges%20st%C3%B6rre%20vikt)

[tn.se](https://www.tn.se/hallbarhet/41275/ny-rapport-offentlig-upphandling-maste-bli-mer-cirkular/#:~:text=Rapporten%2C%20som%20lanseras%20under%20Stockholm,samt%20nationell%20harmonisering%20av%20upphandlingskrav)

. This trend means more public clients will demand reuse. Although hotels aren’t usually public, the hotel industry can voluntarily align – and some are. For example, Scandic Hotels, as referenced, claim they prioritize recycled and reusable materials

[scandichotelsgroup.com](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/sv/hallbarhet/vision-och-strategi/sleep/#:~:text=Sleep%20,samband%20med%20byggnation%20och%20renovering)

. This often translates into RFPs to design firms like “please incorporate upcycled furniture where possible and report the carbon savings.” In summary, LOU itself doesn’t mandate circular economy, but it enables it. Fyra should monitor public sector developments as they often lead the way. Requirements that start in city hall renovations today could be standard expectation in commercial projects tomorrow. Also, if working with any municipality (like renting city-owned property for a hotel), be aware of potential procurement rules affecting what you can do with fit-out (some cities might require you to procure certain things via framework contracts – a possible obstacle to buying second-hand unless there’s flexibility).

## **Industry Standards and Voluntary Certifications**

Beyond laws, Sweden’s building sector relies on a web of voluntary standards, certification systems, and industry practices that effectively act as “soft” regulations. For a hotel project, the following are highly relevant:

* Byggvarubedömningen (BVB): This is a widely used system for environmental and health assessment of building products. Many large property owners (e.g. Vasakronan, Skanska) require that all materials in their projects are rated in BVB and achieve at least “Recommended” or “Accepted” rating (avoiding products rated “Avoid” (Undviks) or un-rated). BVB evaluates products on chemical content and life-cycle aspects. Recently, BVB has incorporated more circular criteria – for instance, a *recycling criterion* that looks at how easily a product’s materials can be recovered at end of life  
* [byggvarubedomningen.se](https://byggvarubedomningen.se/nyheter-press/nyheter-press/kriterieandringar-som-trader-i-kraft-15-september/#:~:text=%C3%84ndring%20i%20Livscykelkriteriet%20%C3%85tervinning%20%C3%85tervinningskriteriet,till%20%C3%B6kad%20%C3%A5tervinning%20i%20byggprojekten)  
* . An example is mineral wool insulation: previously, since it’s often landfilled at demolition, it got a low score, but BVB updated criteria to give a better score if off-cuts during construction are recycled  
* [byggvarubedomningen.se](https://byggvarubedomningen.se/nyheter-press/nyheter-press/kriterieandringar-som-trader-i-kraft-15-september/#:~:text=%C3%84ndring%20i%20Livscykelkriteriet%20%C3%85tervinning%20%C3%85tervinningskriteriet,till%20%C3%B6kad%20%C3%A5tervinning%20i%20byggprojekten)  
* . This shows a shift to reward circular practices. However, reused products are not automatically in the BVB database. If Fyra wants to use a reclaimed material, one challenge is it won’t have a BVB rating unless someone has specifically had it assessed. Some projects handle this by either applying for a project-specific assessment or by using an “equivalent evidence” approach (e.g. a reclaimed brick can be compared to a similar new brick which has a rating). It’s important to discuss with the client how to address this. If the hotel’s own sustainability policy or their investor demands BVB compliance, you may need a strategy – possibly limiting reused items to those made of known, clean materials that you can justify. The Fastighetsägarna’s guidance on reuse suggests documenting reused items in a logbook and tagging their content, even if they cannot be formally rated  
* [fastighetskontoret.stockholm](https://fastighetskontoret.stockholm/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2025/02/Anvisning-Byggvarubedomningen-for-Fastighetskontoret-2025-02-12-1.pdf#:~:text=,men%20inte%20taggas%20som%20%C3%A5terbruk)  
* [fastighetsagarna.se](https://www.fastighetsagarna.se/globalassets/dokument/pdf/stockholm/fastighetsagarnastockholm_vagledning_aterbruk_2024.pdf#:~:text=,r%C3%B6r%20h%C3%A5llbarhet%20och%20cirkul%C3%A4r%20ekonomi)  
* .  
* SundaHus and others: Similar to BVB, SundaHus is another material assessment system in Sweden. It rates products A to D. The considerations are comparable (chemical safety, etc.). Again, reused items won’t be in their database unless specifically added. Open dialog with whoever is responsible for environmental tracking on the project about how to treat reused items – often they might allow it if you provide a safety datasheet or lab analysis proving no harmful content. This is a developing area – industry organizations are actively figuring out how to incorporate reuse into these databases.  
* Green Building Certifications: Many hotels pursue sustainability certifications for marketing and ESG reasons. Common ones in Sweden: Miljöbyggnad (run by SGBC), BREEAM, LEED, and also Nordic Swan Ecolabel for hotels or Green Key for hotel operations. These systems have criteria that either directly or indirectly favor circular economy:  
  * *Miljöbyggnad:* Version 3.1 has indicators for indoor environment and materials. While it doesn’t explicitly require reuse, it does require documenting all building materials and avoiding dangerous substances (so reused items must be accounted for). If aiming for a high rating, having reused content could help in the “Resource use” narrative, but there isn’t a numeric score for % reuse yet. However, Miljöbyggnad does reward low climate impact, which reuse contributes to.  
  * *BREEAM-SE:* BREEAM has specific credits for reused materials – e.g. up to 1 point if you use at least 5% reused or 10% reused (by cost) in the project. It also has credits for resource management plans and for life-cycle assessment. So a hotel going for BREEAM “Excellent” would strongly motivate reuse. BREEAM also insists on construction waste below certain benchmarks, which reuse helps achieve.  
  * *LEED:* LEED v4 has credits for Building Life-Cycle Impact Reduction (including reuse of building elements) and for Furniture reuse (in the Interiors rating). So an interior-focused project could get LEED points by reusing furniture and fixtures.  
  * *Nordic Swan Ecolabel (for hotels and restaurants):* This is an operational certification focusing on energy, water, chemicals, and waste in the running of the hotel. The criteria (generation 4\) include requirements to have an environmental purchasing policy for furnishings and to sort waste etc. While it doesn’t explicitly say “use reclaimed furniture,” it does favor long-lasting quality and ecolabelled products. Some Swan-certified hotels have indeed incorporated reclaimed furnishings as part of their concept. The Ecolabel also limits certain chemicals (like no halogenated flame retardants in furniture), which again means if you reuse furniture, it must meet those criteria or be pre-checked.  
  * *Green Key:* Similar to Swan, it’s about operations (for example, Green Key wants a plan for reducing waste, donating used items, etc.). A hotel with Green Key would likely be supportive of reuse in renovations because it aligns with their ethos.

In summary, while voluntary, these standards influence client expectations. Fyra should ask at project start: does the client have a certification target or internal standard? Many Nordic hotel chains have in-house guidelines (e.g., Scandic’s sustainability handbook) which might specify things like all new furniture must have an environmental label, or no PVC in wallpapers, etc. If the project is to be Svanenmärkt or similar, ensure reused items won’t jeopardize compliance – usually they won’t, as reuse often helps, but one must ensure, for instance, that a reused armchair still meets flame retardancy without banned chemicals (since Swan prohibits certain flame retardants – a tricky area if the chair is old). Standards and Testing: To verify compliance of reused elements, sometimes testing to Swedish/EN standards is necessary:

* Fire testing standards: EN 13501-1 is the classification method for reaction to fire of materials (A1, A2, B, etc.). If reusing wall panels, you might send a sample to RISE (Research Institutes of Sweden) for testing to get a Euroclass rating. Likewise, NT FIRE 047 or similar standards apply to furniture in public spaces. Expect to possibly test upholstery to EN 1021, or a door to EN 1634 for fire resistance if it’s critical and no data exists. There are accredited labs in Sweden (RISE, SP Fire) that can do this, but it can be costly and take weeks, so plan accordingly.  
* Structural standards: Follow Eurocode calculations, maybe test old concrete strength by taking cores, etc. There are standards for testing anchors in old concrete, for example, if reusing an existing concrete wall but hanging new loads.  
* Furniture durability: EN 16139 is a strength test for chairs and tables for non-domestic use. If you procure vintage chairs for a lobby, consider having one sample undergo EN 16139 at a lab to ensure it can handle the loads of a modern hotel use. It’s not legally mandated, but it manages risk (nobody wants a chair collapsing under a guest). Similarly, EN 1728/1730 are test methods for seating and tables.  
* Electrical safety: If reusing lighting or appliances, they should conform to current electrical safety standards (SS-EN standards for luminaries, etc.). Have a certified electrician inspect or refurbish them to meet “SELV” requirements or whatever applies. This is covered under Elsäkerhetsverket regulations rather than building code – but very important.

All these voluntary and standard considerations reinforce one message: document everything. For each reused item, have a “paper trail,” whether that’s original spec sheets, test reports, or at least a written professional assessment. This not only appeases regulators but gives confidence to the client and insurer.

## **Regional Variations: Stockholm vs. Göteborg vs. Malmö**

The application of these rules and the general enthusiasm for circular solutions can differ by city. Here is a breakdown of Sweden’s three largest city regions: Stockholm (capital city): Stockholm stad has high sustainability ambitions on paper. It adopted a Handlingsplan för cirkulärt byggande 2021–2024 focusing on reducing construction waste

[miljobarometern.stockholm.se](https://miljobarometern.stockholm.se/miljomal/handlingsplan-for-cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=Detta%20%C3%A4r%20Stockholms%20stads%20f%C3%B6rsta,har%20fokus%20p%C3%A5%20minskat%20byggavfall)

. The city has implemented internal measures such as creating a circular construction hub (an internal center to advise departments on reuse) and piloted use of digital marketplaces for surplus materials

[miljobarometern.stockholm.se](https://miljobarometern.stockholm.se/miljomal/handlingsplan-for-cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=Handlingsplanen%20%C3%A4r%20ett%20f%C3%B6rsta%20steg,att%20utveckla%20mer%20kostnadseffektiva%20l%C3%B6sningar)

. In terms of enforcement, Stockholm’s building officials are known to be *thorough*. The bygglov process here is quite strict on documentation – expect that any deviation or innovative approach (like using non-CE-marked components) will undergo careful scrutiny. On the flip side, the city officials are increasingly familiar with circular concepts (thanks to pilot projects). Lead times for bygglov/anmälan in Stockholm are moderate to long (it’s a busy city); plan for \~10 weeks for a renovation permit decision. Local initiatives: Stockholm’s waste management company has established “Återbruksgallerian” (Reuse gallery) and pop-up reuse depots where contractors can drop off or pick up materials – indicating city support. The city also runs Stockholm Sustainable Tourism programs which encourage hotels to go green (though more about operations). Enforcement reputation: I would classify Stockholm as moderately strict but supportive. They will enforce the letter of the law (e.g., you won’t get away with an uncertified fire door), but they are also willing to grant permissions if you build a solid case (such as approving a slight energy shortfall if you prove huge reuse benefits). The city’s Environment Department might actually applaud a circular approach and not oppose it as long as you meet safety. Notably, if a building is historically important, Stockholm’s cultural environment unit is very protective – that can actually facilitate reuse of original features but might hamper changes. One challenge in Stockholm is simply scale – many projects happening, so authorities have less time per project. It helps to have a local consultant who knows the specific handläggare (case officers). Stockholm also has borough-specific conditions occasionally. Case example: Hobo Hotel in central Stockholm did a retrofit with many reused decor items; they navigated regulations by focusing reuse on non-structural, non-fire-critical items and had no major issues in approval because they weren’t touching life-safety systems. That strategy – reuse creatively in low-risk applications – tends to go smoothly. Göteborg (Gothenburg): Gothenburg is often seen as Sweden’s leader in circular building practices. The city’s climate goal (climate neutral by 2030\) drives them to innovate. They initiated “Handslaget för cirkulärt byggande”, a pact among city authorities and industry to scale up reuse

. Gothenburg’s municipal real estate arm, Löfvägen/Stadsfastighetsförvaltningen, has mandated that all their projects prioritize reuse, implement climate budgets, and treat demolition as last resort

[nordicconstruction.se](https://www.nordicconstruction.se/2025/05/13/aterbruk-i-praktiken-goteborg-visar-vagen-mot-cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=Stadsfastighetsf%C3%B6rvaltningen%20har%20st%C3%A4llt%20om%20sin,d%C3%A4r%20hundratusentals%20g%C3%B6teborgare%20vistas%20dagligen)

. This is quite progressive – it means the city’s own plan examiners and inspectors are getting used to seeing reuse plans. Enforcement-wise, Gothenburg is strict on fundamentals but very open to circular methods. They won’t waive a safety requirement, but they might help you find a compliant way to achieve it with reused elements. The building permit process in Gothenburg is typically a bit faster than Stockholm (perhaps 6–8 weeks for a reno permit) and officials there report fewer appeals and simpler politics in permitting. Local support: Gothenburg has Business Region Göteborg actively running circular economy networks and even giving awards (as cited: “Årets Återbrukare” awards to city projects

[nordicconstruction.se](https://www.nordicconstruction.se/2025/05/13/aterbruk-i-praktiken-goteborg-visar-vagen-mot-cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=G%C3%B6teborgs%20Stadsfastighetsf%C3%B6rvaltning%20uts%C3%A5gs%20till%20%C3%85rets,att%20etablera%20en%20storskalig%20%C3%A5terbruksmarknad)

). So the culture among developers and builders is embracing reuse. A hotel project in Gothenburg could tap into these networks – e.g., find local suppliers of reclaimed materials easily, or get advice from the city’s climate advisors who exist to help meet climate goals. In Gothenburg, enforcement reputation can be described as *innovative but rigorous*. For example, if you propose using reclaimed bricks, the city might actually welcome it as aligning with their waste reduction plan – *but* they will expect full documentation that those bricks have appropriate frost resistance, etc. They might even have a reference from another project in town that did it. The fire brigade (Räddningstjänsten) in Gothenburg is also known to be collaborative; they’ve worked on solutions like allowing old wooden structures if additional sprinklers are installed, etc. Case example: The “Loop Hotel” (hypothetical name for example) might find Gothenburg the easiest to get approval for, say, a reused timber interior wall, because the authorities there have likely seen something similar and the city politicians back them to allow experimental sustainable solutions. Malmö: Malmö has a strong sustainability profile as well – known for green building (the Western Harbour development, etc.). The city has been part of the Big City agreement with Stockholm and Gothenburg on circular building

[goteborg.se](https://goteborg.se/wps/wcm/connect/5ef28a12-8115-4ee4-bf8e-6d015eaebbcb/Slutpresentation+Storstads%C3%B6verenskommelse+f%C3%B6r+cirkul%C3%A4rt+byggande+2030_f%C3%B6rstudie.pdf?MOD=AJPERES#:~:text=,cirkul%C3%A4rt%20byggande%20fr%C3%A5n%20nisch%20till)

 and collaborates via forums like CCBuild (a national platform for construction reuse, which Malmö’s Greenhouse project contributed to). Malmö’s planning office tends to be practical and outcome-focused. Building permit processing times are moderate (similar to Gothenburg). Malmö has historically been bold with eco-innovations (they did passive houses early, etc.), so a circular interior should not be shocking to them. Local enforcement: They pay special attention to social sustainability too – for example, if reusing components, ensure they still meet accessibility because Malmö will check that (they pride themselves on inclusive design). The city has initiatives like “Cradle to Cradle inspire Malmö”, and their procurement for city projects (like schools) has included circular requirements. So like Gothenburg, Malmö officials are conceptually on board. One difference: Malmö has a smaller historic building stock than Stockholm, but many more 1960s-70s buildings – which are ripe for circular renovation. The city did a notable project called Sege Park where an old hospital was transformed with massive reuse of materials. That gave the stadsbyggnadskontor there familiarity in approving reused structural elements, etc. Enforcement style: Malmö might be described as “pragmatic green” – they want the sustainable solution but will be very pragmatic on code. They won’t create unnecessary hurdles; if something doesn’t work, they’ll just say “no, but do this instead.” Comparative Table:

| Aspect | Stockholm (capital) | Gothenburg (Göteborg) | Malmö |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Sustainability Ambition | High (official programs for circular building) but large bureaucracy [miljobarometern.stockholm.se](https://miljobarometern.stockholm.se/miljomal/handlingsplan-for-cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=Detta%20%C3%A4r%20Stockholms%20stads%20f%C3%B6rsta,har%20fokus%20p%C3%A5%20minskat%20byggavfall) . | Very High (national leader, Handslag initiative) [nordicconstruction.se](https://www.nordicconstruction.se/2025/05/13/aterbruk-i-praktiken-goteborg-visar-vagen-mot-cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=Stadsfastighetsf%C3%B6rvaltningen%20har%20st%C3%A4llt%20om%20sin,d%C3%A4r%20hundratusentals%20g%C3%B6teborgare%20vistas%20dagligen) . | High (part of national initiatives, innovative projects). |
| Building Permit Process | Thorough reviews, longer lead times (\~10+ weeks). Online system but can be complex. | Collaborative reviews, moderate lead times (\~6–8 weeks). Possibly more flexible on minor deviations. | Efficient reviews, moderate lead times (\~8 weeks). Practical approach, less formal perhaps than capital. |
| Enforcement Strictness | Strict on compliance; little gets overlooked. Will enforce docs for everything. | Strict on code but *encourages* circular solutions; finding compliant pathways is part of their ethos. | Strict where needed, but pragmatic. Likely to enforce critical items and be lenient on minor issues. |
| Reuse/Circular Support | Has internal support (reuse center, etc.), offering guidance; several pilot projects in pipeline. | Extremely supportive network; city-owned projects mandate reuse giving lots of know-how; awards/recognition for reuse leaders. | Supportive, has done notable reuse projects; engages in cross-city learning; active in CCBuild (material exchange platform). |
| Notable Challenges | High workload on officials can mean slower feedback; heritage restrictions can be tight in old town. | If not a city project, persuading private sector contractors to follow city’s high bar might be needed (but city will applaud ambition). | Fewer local reuse suppliers than Stockholm maybe (smaller market), but improving; ensuring quality of reused in a city known for cost-efficiency. |
| Insurance & Fire | Large city means insurers are very experienced – likely standard demands (sprinklers in high-risk, etc.). Fire department strict on hotels, frequent inspections. | Insurers and fire officials engaged in climate goals too; might see more sprinklers or novel solutions (like mist systems) accepted for old buildings. | Insurers moderately strict. Fire service in Skåne cooperates regionally – known to enforce code but also promote fire prevention tech. |

Which city is most “circular-friendly”? All three cities are moving in the right direction, but Gothenburg stands out as particularly advanced in integrating circular economy into actual building practices (not just strategy). The presence of a broad coalition of public and private players there focusing on reuse

[nordicconstruction.se](https://www.nordicconstruction.se/2025/05/13/aterbruk-i-praktiken-goteborg-visar-vagen-mot-cirkulart-byggande/#:~:text=klimatledarskap,modellen%20redan%20f%C3%A5tt%20praktiskt%20genomslag)

 means a richer ecosystem for sourcing reclaimed materials and a regulatory environment that understands them. If Fyra were to launch a showcase circular hotel, Gothenburg might offer the path of least resistance and most support. That said, Stockholm, being larger, has a more developed second-hand market (important for sourcing) and a trend-setting effect – a successful project in Stockholm can influence the rest of the country. As a strategy: start where it’s easiest to get it right (Gothenburg or Malmö for a pilot where local authorities might even help promote it), then roll out in Stockholm armed with that experience and reference.

## **Upcoming Regulatory Changes (0–5 Year Horizon)**

The regulatory landscape is dynamic, with several pipeline changes that will impact circular construction in Sweden: Short Term (0–2 years):

* New Building Code (“Möjligheternas byggregler”): Boverket is overhauling the building regulations to be more flexible and functional-based. The first stage launched July 2025 (new simplified rules structure  
* [boverket.se](https://www.boverket.se/sv/PBL-kunskapsbanken/regler-om-byggande/boverkets-konstruktionsregler/overgripande-bestammelser/krav-vid-andring/#:~:text=Den%201%20juli%202025%20b%C3%B6rjade,nya%20byggregler%20att%20g%C3%A4lla)  
* ). By 2026, older prescriptive rules will phase out. This might actually benefit reuse – a functional code focuses on *performance outcomes* rather than detailed specs, which could make it easier to justify alternative solutions (e.g. if you can show a reused material performs as needed, it’s acceptable). Fyra should stay updated via Boverket’s newsletters on how the new code treats existing buildings; Boverket had an assignment to propose easier rules for renovations  
* [regeringen.se](https://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/9def8781c1e44d9a8b7378e935bedb8e/boverkets-rapport-lattnader-i-kraven-pa-byggnader-vid-andring-och-ombyggnad-202512.pdf#:~:text=,Uppdraget)  
*  which could lead to legal relief (like not forcing full new-build standards in every scenario).  
* Building Permit Reforms: As cited, the government has proposed and the Riksdag (parliament) has approved changes to PBL to simplify bygglov processes  
* [riksdagen.se](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/betankande/ett-nytt-regelverk-for-bygglov_hd01cu2/#:~:text=Ett%20nytt%20regelverk%20f%C3%B6r%20bygglov,mer%20%C3%A4ndam%C3%A5lsenligt%20regelverk%20f%C3%B6r%20bygglov)  
* [arkitekten.se](https://arkitekten.se/nyheter/regeringen-vill-genomfora-massiv-forandring-av-bygglovsreglerna/#:~:text=Regeringen%20vill%20genomf%C3%B6ra%20massiv%20f%C3%B6r%C3%A4ndring,kommunerna%20hanterar%20med%20%C3%B6ver)  
* . Effective Dec 2025, more types of minor changes will be permit-free or only require notification. For interiors, it’s expected that some things like changing internal layouts in commercial buildings might be easier, especially if no impact on fire safety. This could reduce administrative burden for hotel renovations – possibly no full permit if you’re not altering load-bearing elements or usage. However, it’s wise to confirm with each municipality, as local interpretations and additional requirements (especially in detailed plan areas) can still apply.  
* Climate Declaration Phase 2: The klimatdeklaration currently is just reporting. By 2027, the government has tasked Boverket to introduce carbon cap values – i.e., maximum allowed kg CO₂/m² for new buildings  
* [byggindustrin.se](https://www.byggindustrin.se/om/klimatdeklaration/#:~:text=klimatdeklaration%20,11%20juni%202020%2C%2007%3A00)  
* . Also under consideration is extending the requirement to larger renovation projects and including more life-cycle stages. This means that in a few years, any substantial hotel addition or major renovation might need to do a climate declaration and potentially meet a limit. Reuse of materials will be a major strategy to cut carbon – so this regulatory trend is actually a strong business case for Fyra’s approach. We can expect stepwise tightening: e.g., 2027 introduce a limit (maybe only structure and envelope counted at first), then tighten it by 2030 and include more components. Action: start doing LCA calculations on projects now (there are tools like OneClickLCA, etc.) to be ahead of the curve.  
* Digital Product Passports (DPP): As part of the EU’s Sustainable Products Initiative, digital product passports will be introduced for certain products. Likely starting with batteries (2026), then potentially for construction products like steel, cement, etc. Possibly by \~2030 many building products will have a QR code with info on materials, repair, etc. While this is a bit farther out, once in place it will greatly aid reuse – because you could scan a component and get its properties. Sweden will implement any EU regulation on this. Fyra should watch for pilot projects on digitized material banks (Stockholm and other cities are testing logging building components in BIM with material metadata). Within 5 years, it’s plausible large new buildings will come with a “materials passport” – making future reuse easier.  
* Extended Producer Responsibility Expansion: EU and national authorities are evaluating new EPR schemes. Within a 2–5 year horizon, furniture EPR could become reality (some EU states have it already, and Sweden often follows suit). This could mean when a hotel discards furniture, the producers (or a collective system) must take them back. It would encourage designing furniture for disassembly and reuse. For Fyra, this means in future projects, obtaining reused furniture might be facilitated by producer take-back programs (they might refurbish old pieces and offer them as second-life products). Also, flooring and interior fittings EPR might emerge (the EU has hinted at construction product EPR possibilities). Keep an eye on the Ministry of Environment’s announcements and EU directives in revision (Waste Framework Directive revisions, etc.).  
* Chemicals and Bans: Expect continuous updates to REACH restricted substances and POPs lists. For example, PFAS (the “forever chemicals”) are likely to face a broad ban in the EU soon. BVB already added criteria for PFAS  
* [byggvarubedomningen.se](https://byggvarubedomningen.se/nyheter-press/nyheter-press/kriterieandringar-som-trader-i-kraft-15-september/#:~:text=Nytt%20kriterium%20f%C3%B6r%20Kemiskt%20inneh%C3%A5ll%3A,polymera%20och%20icke%20polymera%20PFAS)  
* . For interiors, this could affect treatments (stain-resistant coatings on textiles etc.). Reused items might ironically have *more* PFAS (e.g. older textiles with water-repellent coating). If a ban comes, selling those might become illegal. It’s worth keeping track via Kemikalieinspektionen (Swedish Chemicals Agency) of any “sunset dates” for substances that could be present in older materials.

Medium Term (3–5 years):

* EU Circular Economy Action Plan milestones: By 2030, the EU wants significant circularity gains. We already covered DPP and EPR. Additionally, public procurement laws at EU level may evolve to mandate circular criteria for public projects (not yet mandatory, but discussions ongoing). Also the Green Taxonomy (for sustainable finance) includes criteria for circular economy in construction – by 2025, many investors will only classify a building as green if it has e.g. \>5% reused content or high recycling rates. This indirectly forces developers to adopt circular methods to access green financing. In a few years, a hotel project seeking green bonds *will* have to demonstrate circular resource use.  
* Building code energy/carbon tightening: Sweden has nearly zero energy building standards already, but there might be new requirements like embodied carbon limits (as mentioned) and possibly mandatory climate adaptation measures which could include reuse (for example, some talk about mandatory consideration of reuse feasibility before demolition – which might become a rule requiring a “resource efficiency plan” along with demolition permit). Boverket’s report to promote circular economy suggested adding a requirement for a Resource Management Plan in PBL  
* [fastighetsagarna.se](https://www.fastighetsagarna.se/globalassets/rapporter/fran-sveriges-webb/riv-hinder-for-aterbruk_forslag-for-hallbart-resursanvandade.pdf?bustCache=1759676101287#:~:text=%C3%A4r%20dock%20begr%C3%A4nsad%20och%20h%C3%A4r,material%20vid%20renovering%20och%20ombyggnation)  
* . If that gets legislated, any renovation permit application may need a plan outlining how you will reuse or recycle materials. This could be reality in 2–4 years given growing interest (some other EU countries are doing it).  
* Skills and training requirements: As circular practices grow, there may be new certification for professionals (e.g. a certificate for “Circular Construction Site Management” or additions to byggarbetsmiljösamordnare (BAS) training to cover reuse handling). While not law, these could become quasi-mandatory if clients start demanding them. Staying involved in industry groups (like Sweden Green Building Council’s circularity group, etc.) will help anticipate this.

Political environment: Sweden’s next general election is in 2026\. If there’s a change to a government with Green Party influence, regulatory drive on climate and circular economy could accelerate (e.g. tougher waste reduction targets, subsidies for reuse centers, etc.). Conversely, the current center-right government is more focused on cutting red tape and costs, which has meant slowing down some environmental initiatives. For instance, the new government in 2022 considered delaying or softening climate declaration requirements (though in practice they are proceeding with the 2027 cap albeit potentially at a lenient level). Conclusion: Fyra should remain apolitical but adaptive – essentially ready to comply with stricter rules if they come, but also able to take advantage if rules are loosened (for example, if building code is made more renovation-friendly, leverage that to do deeper retrofits). Where to follow developments: Key sources include:

* Boverket’s website and newsletter – they post consultations (remisser) on upcoming rules (e.g. new BBR drafts).  
* Sweden Green Building Council (SGBC) – active in advocating and often know what’s coming down the pipe, plus they host events on new EU laws (like taxonomy).  
* Trade media like *Byggindustrin* and *Fastighetsvärlden* regularly report on regulatory changes in building and real estate, often summarizing what practitioners need to know.  
* Government inquiries (SOU) – for instance, an SOU report on circular economy in construction might come and propose new laws; these are published on regeringen.se and open for comment.

In summary, the next 5 years will likely bring *more emphasis on climate impact and resource efficiency in regulation*, rather than less. The exact mechanisms (be it a requirement for reuse plans, or higher taxes on waste) remain to be seen, but the trajectory is clear. Fyra can prepare by building internal capacity in LCA, keeping meticulous records of reuse benefits, and perhaps participating in pilot projects or committees – shaping the rules rather than just reacting.

## **Compliance Strategy for Fyra: From Planning to Handover**

Translating the regulatory landscape into day-to-day project actions is crucial. Below is a phase-by-phase compliance checklist, along with risk mitigation measures and documentation tools, tailored for a circular hospitality renovation:

### **Pre-Design Phase (Feasibility & Due Diligence)**

* Regulatory Scoping: Determine if the building is culturally protected (check if it’s listed or in a heritage area – triggers PBL 8:13 rules). If yes, plan a meeting with the local conservation officer to discuss what reuse of original features is encouraged or any special permit needed for changes.  
* Building Permit Needs: Analyze the scope – will this project require bygglov or just an anmälan? (E.g., if only interior changes not affecting structure or use, likely anmälan). Early on, contact the municipality’s bygglovshandläggare informally to confirm. If building use is changing (say part of hotel to apartments, etc.), that clearly needs bygglov for change of use.  
* Plan for Bygglov Application: If you anticipate needing a permit, note key submission requirements: updated drawings, technical descriptions, fire protection report (brandskyddsbeskrivning), accessibility report. Identify any aspects that might need dispensation (e.g., existing stair is narrower than code but will remain). Start gathering justification for those (like engineer’s statement or reference to culture value).  
* Environmental Survey: Commission an asbestos/PCB survey if building is old enough. Also test for lead in paint and mercury in any old thermostats, etc. Knowing these results now allows planning remediation in the budget and timeline  
* [faringsotra.se](https://www.faringsotra.se/asbest-i-hus/#:~:text=Asbest%20i%20hus%20%E2%80%93%20Vad,att%20en%20asbestkartl%C3%A4ggning%20m%C3%A5ste%20g%C3%B6ras)  
* .  
* Reuse Strategy: Develop an initial Waste Management Plan focusing on reuse: do an inventory of what materials/fixtures in the building could be salvaged for reuse either on this project or elsewhere. Also list what materials you propose to source second-hand. This is both for internal planning and will feed permit documentation (some municipalities ask for a demolition waste inventory).  
* Insurance & Fire Consultation: Engage a fire safety engineer to outline fire code implications (especially if you plan to reuse things like interior finishes, doors, etc.). If the hotel is operational or the owner has insurance prerequisites, get those from the client or their insurer. Sometimes insurers require an *independent* fire inspection or certain certifications for materials – better to know upfront. For example, a hotel insurer might say all furniture in guest rooms must at least meet Crib 5 fire test – so you’d then focus on sourcing furniture that either inherently meets that or can be treated.  
* Stakeholder Alignment: Meet with the client (hotel owner/operator) to understand any brand standards or preferences that could affect compliance. For instance, international hotel brands might have their own safety standards that exceed local code (e.g., Marriott might require sprinkler in all areas even if not required by law). Also, discuss sustainability targets: is the client aiming for a certification? That will integrate with compliance (some credits require involving officials, etc.).

### **Design Phase (Planning & Specification)**

* Fire Safety Design: Work closely with the fire consultant to integrate reuse. For every material or product being considered for reuse, ensure there is a plan to satisfy fire requirements. Examples: You want to use reclaimed wood planks as wall cladding in the lobby – check if treated to Class B-s1,d0; if not, specify an intumescent coating and testing. If reusing vintage light fixtures, design in extra smoke detectors or use only in fully sprinklered areas to mitigate any risk. Document all these decisions in the Brandskyddsdokumentation that will go in the permit application.  
* Structural Checks: If you plan to expose old structure or reuse it in new ways (say hanging a new load from an old beam), have the structural engineer do calculations now. If structural elements from elsewhere are to be installed (e.g., reclaimed steel columns for decor), make sure their load-bearing role (if any) is accounted for or they are treated as non-structural (purely decorative).  
* Accessibility Compliance: Check the layout against BBR Chapter 3 and the Swedish accessibility standards (like Bygg ikapp). Hotels need a certain number of accessible rooms, turning radii in rooms, etc. If you’re reusing old doors, ensure clear widths will be 0.8 m etc. Plan modifications (like shaving down a door threshold) to meet accessibility while still using the door.  
* Documentation of Materials: For each significant reused material, prepare a technical datasheet in the specification. For example, if using second-hand marble flooring, write a spec section that includes “Marble tile – reused – size X – sourced from Y – compressive strength class Z (per EN standard test result attached) – fire class A1 – no coating.” Including these in design docs will later make it easier to show inspectors what was intended and that it meets requirements.  
* Engage Suppliers Early: Reach out to suppliers of reused materials during design. For instance, if planning to get reclaimed wood flooring, find the supplier and ask for any certifications or test reports they have (moisture content, strength grading, formaldehyde emissions, etc.). If they have none, decide if you will test a sample or choose a different supplier. Ensure any treatment needed (e.g., flame retardant, woodworm treatment) is specified clearly.  
* Climate Calculation: Do a preliminary carbon footprint calculation of the design, highlighting savings from reuse. While not required by code for renos yet, this serves two purposes: (1) it will be needed if you pursue any green certification, and (2) it provides backup if you need to negotiate with authorities (you can show, “By allowing us to reuse these elements, we avoid X tons CO₂”). It aligns with PBL’s resource management aim  
* [fastighetsagarna.se](https://www.fastighetsagarna.se/globalassets/rapporter/fran-sveriges-webb/riv-hinder-for-aterbruk_forslag-for-hallbart-resursanvandade.pdf?bustCache=1759676101287#:~:text=skapa%20en%20ny%20praxis,I%20punkt%209%20anges)  
* .  
* Budget for Testing: Incorporate in the budget line items for material testing and certification. For example, allocate funds for fire testing 1 chair model, strength testing an old railing, chemical testing of one wood sample for hazardous substances. This way, if the official asks for proof, you have it ready. Testing lead times can be long, so decide which tests are critical and book labs in advance.  
* Prepare Permit Documents: Assemble everything for the bygglov/anmälan submission:  
  * *Drawings:* clearly indicate any changes, use of materials (some municipalities appreciate notes on drawings like “wall finish: reclaimed wood panel, treated to fire class B”).  
  * *Technical Description:* Write about the project’s circular approach briefly but focus on compliance: e.g., “All new and reused materials will fulfill relevant BBR requirements. A list of materials and their classifications is attached.” Mention if you seek any deviation/variance (e.g., existing stair to remain despite lower headroom, justified by cultural value).  
  * *Brandskyddsdokumentation:* as above, include anything non-standard. If sprinklering the building to compensate for, say, more combustible interior, note that.  
  * *Kontrollplan:* Draft a kontrolplan that includes checkpoints like “Inspect documentation for reused materials (fire certificates, strength, etc.) before installation” and “Test installed firefighting equipment covers new and existing areas” etc.  
* Then submit and be ready to answer questions. Typically, officials might come back asking for clarifications, especially if they see mention of reused materials – they might ask, “please provide the fire rating details of this reclaimed item.” Be ready with those answers.

### **Procurement Phase (Bidding & Purchasing)**

* Contractor Engagement: When tendering to general contractors or subcontractors, make sure the tender documents clearly state the reuse scope and compliance responsibilities. Contractors in Sweden are used to standard jobs; a less enlightened one might throw everything out unless instructed otherwise. So, include in contracts: *“Contractor shall follow the Resource and Waste Plan – items marked for reuse shall be carefully dismantled and stored for reinstallation”*. Assign responsibility for testing: *“Contractor to provide samples of reused materials for testing as identified (see list) and include cost for any necessary lab tests.”* If you have already done tests, share results to avoid duplication.  
* Supplier Documentation: For each reused product supplier, obtain needed documents before purchase. E.g., if buying reclaimed carpet tiles, get a formaldehyde emission class report (EU standard E1 class is needed). If the supplier doesn’t have it, either test a sample or ensure in contract that material must meet certain standard and can be returned if not.  
* Quality Control of Salvaged Items: Arrange inspections of salvaged items upon acquisition. If you source, say, antique doors for the hotel, have a joiner or fire consultant inspect them on arrival to verify they are solid, can be fitted with self-closers, etc., or identify required refurbishment. Document any refurbishment plan (e.g., add intumescent strips to the door frame) and ensure it’s acceptable to the fire code official.  
* End-of-Waste Documentation: If you are obtaining something that was formally “waste” (for instance, buying items from a demolition contractor who salvaged them), have them provide an invoice or transfer document that basically states the items now as products. This helps show chain of custody that these are not being illegally moved waste. Ideally, the supplier is a company in the business of used building materials – they essentially act as the “producer” of a secondary product. Keep those purchase records; if anyone later questions where it came from, you can show it was through a legitimate channel.  
* Training & Briefings: Hold a start-up meeting with all trades to explain the reuse plan and any special handling. Emphasize safety (e.g., “some materials are old – assume paint could have lead, use masks when sanding until tests confirm safety”). Also emphasize that if anyone finds something suspect (like an unanticipated asbestos pipe lagging), stop and report it (typical practice, but worth restating given the mix of old/new). Make sure the site waste responsible person knows about sorting obligations (the five+ fractions)  
* [lagen.nu](https://lagen.nu/2020:614#:~:text=Image%3A%20,varandra%20och%20fr%C3%A5n%20annat%20avfall)  
*  and reuse goals (e.g., “these piles of removed fixtures are not trash – they will be picked up for reuse, do not throw in dumpster\!”).  
* Communication with Authorities: If you promised in the bygglov stage any further detail (e.g. to submit test results in the Kontrollplan), now is the time to do it. Sometimes the fire department might want to witness a fire test of an assembly – coordinate if needed. Keeping an open line with the byggnadsinspektör (the inspector from the municipality) during construction is wise; invite them for a site visit early on to show how you’re managing reuse materials – this can build trust that everything is under control for final sign-off.

### **Construction Phase (Execution & Verification)**

* Waste Management & Reuse Implementation: Set up clearly labeled areas on site: e.g., a storage for items to be reinstalled (with weather protection as needed), and separate bins for each waste fraction  
* [lagen.nu](https://lagen.nu/2020:614#:~:text=Image%3A%20,varandra%20och%20fr%C3%A5n%20annat%20avfall)  
* . Monitor that the crew is actually separating (this can be a checkpoint in the internal inspections). Keep receipts from recycling facilities as they come.  
* Site Inspections (Besiktningar): The Kontrollansvarig will do regular check-ups per the Kontrollplan. Key hold-points might include:  
  * Before closing up walls/ceilings, check any reused insulation or materials in them and document they were installed properly and match specs.  
  * Fire stopping: if reusing existing cable penetrations, ensure new intumescent seals are installed – take photos for evidence.  
  * Means of escape: perhaps do a walkthrough with the fire consultant once doors and signs are in place to ensure even reused doors close properly etc.  
* Testing and Commissioning: Carry out any planned material tests on site if applicable (for example, a floor slip resistance test if you reused floor tiles in bathrooms to ensure they meet current slip standards). Commissioning of systems (sprinkler, alarm) should integrate old and new parts – e.g., if old ductwork was reused, make sure it’s clean and doesn’t affect air quality; do an air quality measurement if needed.  
* Changes and Substitutions: Inevitably, some reused items might not work out (maybe during install an old light fixture breaks or an expected batch of reclaimed wood is short). Manage changes with compliance in mind. Any substitution should be equal or better in regulatory terms. E.g., if you cannot get enough reclaimed Class B wood paneling and decide to use a new product for the remainder, ensure it has at least the same fire rating and environmental profile (so that you’re not undermining the justification you gave to authorities or certifications). Significant changes that affect bygglov (like altering something that was in the permit drawings) might need a quick consultation with the city – minor ones can typically be noted and explained at final inspection.  
* Final Inspections and Handover: Before the official slutbesiktning (final inspection), assemble the documentation binder:  
  * Approvals: The startbesked and any communication with authorities.  
  * Kontrollplan results: filled out, with sign-offs from KA and any specialists (for example, fire consultant might sign off that fire sealing of reused structures is OK).  
  * Material documentation: This is crucial – provide the fire class certificates, lab test reports, product sheets for *all* critical materials. Organize it by CSI division or similar. For reused items, include a short narrative if needed: e.g., “Doors type D1-D10 on plans are reused 1950s doors of solid oak. They have been upgraded with self-closers and intumescent strips. Testing of a representative door for fire resistance was conducted at RISE – see report, which indicates it meets EI30  
  * [orust.se](https://www.orust.se/download/18.1c4985fe183bfdb97a246f/1665396582851/L%C3%A4mplig%20brandskyddsniv%C3%A5%20f%C3%B6r%20hotell%20eller%20liknande%20verksamhet%20enligt%20R%C3%A4ddningstj%C3%A4nsten.pdf#:~:text=L%C3%A4gsta%20sk%C3%A4lig%20niv%C3%A5%20p%C3%A5%20befintliga,krav%20st%C3%A4llts%20p%C3%A5%20d%C3%B6rrst%C3%A4ngare%20enligt)  
  * . Therefore, they comply with BBR for hotel room doors.”  
  * Waste report: document how much waste was produced and how much was diverted to reuse/recycling (some municipalities like to see this, and it might be needed for green building credits).  
* When the municipal inspector and possibly the fire marshal come for final inspection, walk them through the building and point out compliance features – especially any unconventional reuse solutions. Since you likely discussed these earlier, it should not be a surprise. Demonstrate any systems (fire alarms, etc.). If you did everything per the approved docs, you’ll get a slutbesked (final clearance).  
* Client Handover: Provide the client with a Building Manual that includes maintenance info for reused elements. For instance, if you installed reclaimed wooden floors, advise on maintenance and note they might behave slightly differently (maybe more movement) – and ensure that this is acceptable. Also hand over any guarantees – note: many reused items won’t have manufacturer warranties, so consider if you as the provider are giving some warranty (the client will expect the whole fit-out to have a defects liability period typically). Clarify in writing which reused elements were refurbished and come with say a 1-year warranty from the refurbisher, vs. which are “as-is” but inspected.

### **Post-Completion and Operations**

* Records for Future: As part of the close-out, deliver a material logbook to the client – essentially a spreadsheet or booklet listing all significant materials and their key properties (fire class, expected replacement year, etc.). This is hugely helpful for the building’s future facility managers and will likely become a required practice in coming years.  
* End-of-Life Plan: Where feasible, include in documentation any take-back or reuse agreements. For example, if a furniture supplier agreed to take back chairs after 10 years for recycling, mention that and include their contact. This goes beyond current legal requirements, but it aligns with EU thinking on circular lifecycle.  
* Monitor and Learn: It’s wise for Fyra to do a post-project review a few months in – check with the hotel facility team if any issues have arisen (doors sticking, etc.). From a compliance view, any serious issue (like a safety system failure) would need addressing immediately regardless of reuse/new. Assuming all is well, gather the lessons to improve the next project.

### **Risk Register & Mitigations**

Identifying specific risks for circular projects, we address them with mitigation strategies (some already touched upon):

* Risk 1: Fire classification failure of reused items. *Likelihood:* Medium-High (using older furniture, panels often presents this). *Impact:* High – could delay opening or force last-minute replacements. Mitigations: Engage fire experts early; test materials in advance; budget and schedule for applying fire-retardant treatments; always have a backup plan (e.g., if the vintage curtains cannot be made flame-safe, have an alternate source of compliant fabric). Also specify performance-based options – e.g. planning sprinklers in every room will generally mitigate a lot of interior finish concerns by code. Clear communication with authorities – get at least informal buy-in on your fire approach before finalizing design  
* [firesafe.se](https://www.firesafe.se/service/brandskydd-i-hotellverksamhet-bb-och-annan-form-av-uthyrning-av-boende/#:~:text=Kontroll%20av%20brandcellsgr%C3%A4nser)  
* .  
* Risk 2: Unknown hazardous chemicals in reused materials. *Likelihood:* Low-Medium (especially if you curate items from reliable sources, risk is low, but there’s always some). *Impact:* High if occurs – could pose health risks or legal issues if, say, a banned substance is present. Mitigations: Source primarily materials from known periods (e.g., post-2000). Require documentation or testing for suspect items (test older foam for PBDE flame retardants, or suspect painted wood for lead). Use Sweden’s PRIO database and Kemikalieinspektionen’s lists to screen anything vintage. If in doubt, avoid using in high-contact areas (for example, you might use an antique decor piece high up on a wall (no contact, minimal risk), but not as a tabletop where people touch/eat off it). Have an abatement plan ready if something is found late (small finds like a bit of asbestos in flooring glue can be fixed with a 1-day abatement crew if planned).  
* Risk 3: Building permit or authority delays. *Likelihood:* Medium in larger cities or if project is complex. *Impact:* Medium – delays cost money and can ruin schedule, but rarely do permits outright deny a whole project if approached correctly. Mitigations: Start the permit process as early as possible – even before full design, one can have pre-application meetings. Involve a local bygglovkonsult for tricky municipalities. Provide authorities with very thorough documentation to preempt questions. Build 4–6 weeks float into the schedule for permitting (as recommended earlier). Also, maintain good relations – a polite, proactive approach with the inspector can sometimes lead to informal OKs that speed things up (e.g. they might allow you to proceed at risk on certain non-critical works while paperwork finalizes).  
* Risk 4: Supplier failure to provide required documentation or quality. *Likelihood:* Medium-High – the reclaimed material market is less standardized, so there is a risk items don’t arrive as advertised. *Impact:* High if a key material can’t be used (could necessitate redesign or new procurement fast). Mitigations: Vet suppliers – prefer those who have experience with larger projects and understand requirements. Write contracts that explicitly require providing certain documents/certifications and allow rejection of goods that don’t meet specs. Maintain a contingency fund for emergency replacement of materials if needed. Also, try to source critical materials from more than one supplier (don’t put all eggs in one basket for, say, all reclaimed tiles). Maintain a good working relationship with testing labs – if you need a quick test on a batch of material that arrived, you can expedite if you have that setup.  
* Risk 5: Policy or regulatory shifts mid-project. *Likelihood:* Low-Medium in a short renovation timeframe, but not impossible (e.g., a sudden ban on a chemical might come into force). *Impact:* Variable. Usually, projects get grandfathered under the rules at permit application, so big changes are unlikely to retroactively apply. But consider longer-term shifts like an economic incentive disappearing or a new requirement like separate reporting. Mitigations: Keep an eye on any relevant news during the project. A subscription to industry updates helps; for instance, if the EU were to ban a certain flame retardant effective immediately, and if your reused furniture has it, you’d need a plan (like replacing those pieces or applying an encapsulant). Design flexibility is key: if something became non-viable, have the design such that an alternative can slot in (e.g., modular design, not relying on one specific rare material throughout). Also maintain conventional supply chains – you may not use them, but having contacts for new materials is a safety net.

When to engage specialists: Fyra should incorporate external specialists at the right moments:

* Fire Consultant: *Always* engage for hotel projects (hotels have complex fire codes). At concept stage itself, get their input. Absolutely necessary if building \>2 stories or with any deviations. They might also liaise with fire authorities which is invaluable.  
* Materials/Chemical Consultant: If the project involves substantial use of older materials (pre-1980s especially), it’s wise to have a chemist or building materials specialist do a review. They can advise what to test for (PCB, asbestos, PAHs in old sealants, etc.). Could be one-time consultation unless problems found.  
* Building Permit Consultant: If Fyra is not deeply familiar with a municipality’s processes, hiring a local consultant or architect-of-record to handle the permit can save time. Particularly in Stockholm or if the project has complications (change of use, etc.), a specialist who daily works with PBL can smooth it out.  
* LCA/Lifecycle Specialist: For projects aiming for certifications or wanting to quantify benefits, an LCA specialist can run the numbers. Also if climate declarations become mandatory for renos, this will be needed. Could be in-house training or an external hire per project.  
* Historic Preservation Expert: If the building is heritage, involve an expert early. They can help negotiate creative solutions (maybe reusing materials from other similar-era buildings to patch missing pieces, etc.) and write the justification that preservation goals align with reuse (often they do\!). Their support can sway the authorities on delicate matters.

Documentation Templates: Fyra should develop and utilize templates to streamline compliance:

* Reused Material Data Sheet Template: A one-page form for each type of reused item capturing: description, source, year of manufacture (if known), any markings/certifications on it, test results, and intended location in project. This can be part of the *byggvarudeklaration* you submit.  
* End-of-Waste Declaration: If applicable, a letter that states something like: “We hereby declare that X units of used brick obtained from Y have been inspected and meet the specifications to be used as construction products in Z project, and are no longer considered waste.” Not an official form, but having it in file might help if any question arises.  
* Traceability Log: A spreadsheet listing each batch of reused components, where they came from (donor site or supplier), and where in the building they went. This is useful if any issue arises later – you can trace back problems or inform maintenance (e.g., “the door in room 101 is from supplier A, with these characteristics”).  
* Testing Register: Keep a table of all tests commissioned (fire, chemical, structural) with dates and outcomes. Attach the lab reports and in the final report highlight compliance (e.g., “Test XYZ confirms the reused flooring achieves Bfl-s1 class, meeting BBR for floor finishes in escape route”). It organizes evidence in one place for the inspector.  
* Compliance Summary Letter: At completion, prepare a concise letter signed by the certified professionals (fire consultant, KA, etc.) stating that to the best of their knowledge, the project meets all applicable requirements, including those related to the reused materials. Essentially a professional assurance – it’s not strictly required, but it can give the client and authorities confidence.

By following the above structured approach, Fyra can effectively manage compliance at every stage while executing a visionary circular project. It turns a complex process into a series of clear tasks and checkpoints.

## **Comparisons: Sweden vs Finland vs Norway – Circular Economy Regulations**

Fyra operates in Finland and is expanding to Sweden and Norway. It’s vital to understand how the regulatory environments differ in terms of circular economy and sustainability in construction: Overall Regulatory Stringency:

* Finland: Finland’s building regulations have historically been slightly less prescriptive than Sweden’s, but a new Building Act (Rakennuslaki) effective 2025 is bringing Finland on par with – or even ahead of – Sweden in some aspects  
* [vvsfinland.fi](https://www.vvsfinland.fi/2023/03/15/nya-bygglagen-trader-i-kraft-1-1-2025/#:~:text=Nya%20bygglagen%20tr%C3%A4der%20i%20kraft,Riksdagen%20godk%C3%A4nde)  
* . The new law explicitly aims to foster circular economy and digitalization  
* [vvsfinland.fi](https://www.vvsfinland.fi/2023/03/15/nya-bygglagen-trader-i-kraft-1-1-2025/#:~:text=Nya%20bygglagen%20tr%C3%A4der%20i%20kraft,Riksdagen%20godk%C3%A4nde)  
* . For example, it requires considering the whole lifecycle carbon emissions of new buildings (Finland is introducing mandatory carbon assessments for buildings a few years ahead of EU requirements). Finland also has had more flexibility for renovations – local building authorities often allow deviations in old buildings more readily than Sweden did. However, with the new law, Finland is formalizing certain requirements (like material passports for new buildings and pre-demolition audits). In terms of stringency on safety/health basics, Finland and Sweden are comparable (both follow Eurocodes, similar fire safety levels, etc.). One might say Finland was traditionally a touch more lenient on retrofits, but that gap is closing.  
* Sweden: As we’ve detailed, Sweden has very comprehensive rules and is stringent in enforcement. The climate declaration law put Sweden at the forefront in Europe for considering construction phase carbon (Finland is following now, Norway not yet). Sweden’s waste sorting law is also among the strictest (with six fractions required  
* [lagen.nu](https://lagen.nu/2020:614#:~:text=Image%3A%20,varandra%20och%20fr%C3%A5n%20annat%20avfall)  
* , whereas some countries only mandate maybe wood, metal, etc.). So in terms of circular economy support, Sweden has strong hard laws for waste and emerging ones for carbon. But ironically, some Swedish rules (like equal new-build standards on old buildings  
* [fastighetsagarna.se](https://www.fastighetsagarna.se/globalassets/rapporter/fran-sveriges-webb/riv-hinder-for-aterbruk_forslag-for-hallbart-resursanvandade.pdf?bustCache=1759676101287#:~:text=Likst%C3%A4lld%20kravniv%C3%A5%20vid%20nybyggnation%20som,bygglov%20vid%20%C3%A4ndring%20av%20bygglov)  
* ) made reuse *harder*. Sweden is aware of this and working on “lättnader” (reliefs) to not penalize reuse unnecessarily. We expect Sweden to maintain high environmental standards, potentially introducing mandatory minimum reuse or recycling levels in public projects.  
* Norway: Norway’s building code (TEK17) is similar in safety standards to Sweden’s, but Norway has been a bit slower to implement environmental requirements in regulation. There is currently no mandatory climate declaration for new buildings in Norway (though many projects do it voluntarily or for BREEAM credits). Norway does have robust waste regulations (as an EEA member, they implement EU waste directives, likely with the same 70% target). Sorting on site in Norway is common, but I’m not sure if there’s a specific law requiring the 5 fractions as in Sweden – however, it’s industry practice to do at least source separation for C\&D waste. Norway has a strong tradition in safety and technical performance, but when it comes to reuse, anecdotal evidence suggests building officials in Norway may have more discretion. Also, Norway’s construction industry is heavily driven by standards and certifications like SINTEF Technical Approval – if you bring a reused product, the question becomes does it have an approval? If not, someone must take responsibility for its performance (similar to Sweden’s approach). Summary: Norway’s formal laws are a bit less demanding on sustainability metrics (no official carbon limit yet, etc.), but that could also mean fewer clear incentives for circularity. That said, Norway’s government and companies are certainly pushing green building – just via voluntary means (e.g., Powerhouse standards, Enova grants for low-carbon).

Public Policy and Incentives for Circularity:

* Finland: The Finnish government launched a National Circular Economy Roadmap and has been proactive with incentives. For instance, there have been tax deductions or grants for renovation and reuse projects (Finland has experimented with lower VAT on repair work to encourage reuse instead of new builds). Also, organizations like Sitra (Finland’s innovation fund) have funded circular construction pilots. Finland is aiming for carbon-neutrality by 2035  
* [boverket.se](https://www.boverket.se/sv/byggande/cirkular-ekonomi/exempel-omvarlden/norden/finland/#:~:text=Finland%20har%20sedan%202021%20arbetat,planet%C3%A4ra%20gr%C3%A4nserna%20f%C3%B6r%20jordens%20b%C3%A4rkraft)  
* , so they see circular economy as key. One concrete thing: the new Finnish law reportedly will require a material inventory and reuse plan before demolition, which if true, is a big regulatory nudge for reuse (Sweden doesn’t yet require that by law, it’s just good practice). So Finland might actually become the easiest place to justify reuse from a policy perspective – the authorities are *telling you to do it* and perhaps providing support.  
* Sweden: Public policy support in Sweden is strong in rhetoric (e.g., Delegation for Circular Economy, etc.) and through some funding programs (Vinnova has funded R\&D on circular materials, Boverket gave out grants for innovative housing including reuse pilots). Also, Sweden’s environmental goals include a circular economy target. But when it comes to direct incentives: so far, not many financial incentives except maybe some procurement preferences and that high landfill/incineration cost (which is indirectly an incentive to avoid waste). The playing field is changing with EU recovery funding – Sweden is using some EU Green Deal money to promote circular construction (the big cities’ initiatives partly tie into that). Another advantage in Sweden: a very active marketplace for reused building components is emerging (multiple startups, online platforms like Kompanjonen, CCBuild database, etc.), arguably more so than in Finland or Norway yet, thanks to that policy push and market size. So support in Sweden often comes from local government and private initiatives rather than national subsidies.  
* Norway: Norway’s government has a broad sustainability strategy, but specific circular economy actions in construction are catching up. Enova (a government fund for energy/climate) has started to fund pilots on low-carbon materials and maybe will fund reuse initiatives. There is talk in Norway of requiring material accounts for buildings in the future (similar to climate declaration). The Norwegian Building Authority has a program “Framtidens Bygg” that looks at sustainability, and they are likely to incorporate more circular criteria. But culturally, Norway’s oil wealth meant less pressure historically to conserve resources; now that is changing with strong climate commitments (Oslo aims for major emissions cuts, etc.). So expect Norway to maybe quickly implement rules once decided – e.g., they might leapfrog by 2025 or so to require climate accounting for all large buildings. On incentives: not sure of specific ones, but green public procurement is picking up there too (Oslo municipality for example requires reuse of some materials in its own projects).

Compliance Complexity:

* Finland: The regulatory system in Finland is somewhat more centralized when it comes to codes (less municipal variance than Sweden, where each municipality can have different interpretations). This can simplify navigation – one set of national guidelines from the Ministry of Environment. However, in practice, Finnish building officials also have discretion. Finland has less of a third-party inspection culture (in Sweden you have kontrollansvarig etc., Finland relies more on the “vastuuhenkilö” responsible person and the municipal building inspector). Finnish permitting is generally efficient and documentation is straightforward. If anything, language might be a barrier (docs in Finnish/Swedish), but Fyra likely handles that. Finnish authorities might not yet be as used to reuse documentation – they may rely more on engineer’s judgment. But with new laws, they will be learning too.  
  * Also, Finland’s documentation burden for new builds will increase with carbon calculations etc., making it closer to Sweden’s level. Historically Finland might have been lighter (no climate decl until now, etc.), but it’s equalizing.  
* Sweden: As we’ve outlined, quite a heavy documentation and inspection regime. You have multiple actors (municipal building authority, independent Kontrollansvarig, sometimes separate fire department review, environmental office if something falls in their domain). This means compliance in Sweden can feel fragmented – you need to please all parties. However, once you know the system, it’s predictable. It does require more paperwork (e.g., the requirement for a Kontrollplan, which Finland doesn’t quite have in the same way). Also, Sweden’s penchant for rating systems (BVB, etc.) adds another quasi-layer of compliance – not law, but industry requirement.  
* Norway: Norway’s system has “local building authorities” like Sweden, but also uses the concept of responsible designers/contractors who must be approved (godkjent) for certain classes of work, putting more onus on professionals to ensure compliance. The municipality then does less micro-checking and more spot checks. In theory, this can make it simpler if you as the responsible designer take responsibility for the reuse solution – you may get it through as long as you sign off on it. There is also no independent kontrollansvarig requirement; the project will have a “responsible controller” but often that’s internal from the contractor or designer. So fewer bureaucratic steps. The tricky part is that Norway is very standards-based; if your solution doesn’t fit a standard or approval, you have to convince the plan- og bygningsetaten on a case-by-case basis. But smaller municipalities might not have expertise and either just approve what the engineer states or conversely be very conservative and say “No, if it’s not documented, we can’t allow it.” It can vary. Anecdotally, Norway has seen relatively fewer reuse projects than Sweden/Finland, so you might encounter more questions simply because it’s new to them.

Cross-Learning and Harmonization:

* The Nordic countries generally share information and work on harmonizing approaches (through Nordics Innovation projects etc.). For example, there is a Nordic network on circular construction trying to align definitions and perhaps allow mutual recognition of documentation. If Fyra has documentation for a reused product from Finland, theoretically Swedish authorities could accept it, especially if it’s in English or meets EU norms. In practice, a test or approval from e.g. VTT in Finland is as good as one from RISE in Sweden – there’s professional respect and often formal equivalence under EU (a test to EN standard in one country is valid in another).  
* Suppliers: Many suppliers operate Nordic-wide. A Finnish supplier of reclaimed wood can ship to Sweden and might already know Swedish expectations (some are doing it). Mutual recognition exists for CE marks, of course. For non-CE things, you rely on engineering judgment, which travels fine.  
* One challenge is language and local codes: Norway’s and Finland’s building codes are in Norwegian/Finnish (though often with similar structure to Swedish). But most technical standards are European shared. So Fyra can often reuse the same technical approach in all three countries, just adjust to local administrative process.

The best practices that Fyra has from Finland (where perhaps reuse of certain components has been done in some pioneering projects) can be ported to Sweden/Norway, but always double-check local fire and structural differences. For instance, Finland uses fire classes like P1/P2 buildings, Norway has occupancy classes somewhat akin – minor differences in how code is written might require slight adjustments (maybe a material allowed in one country’s corridor might need upgrade in another’s). Engaging a local engineer in each country to peer-review is wise. Strategic Recommendation – Easiest Market for Circularity:

Considering all, Finland currently (pre-2025 law fully in effect) might be the most straightforward because officials and industry are keen but perhaps not as administratively heavy as Sweden. But with the new law, Finland is setting high goals (which is good for a company specializing in circular economy – you’ll be in demand). Sweden is both challenging and rewarding: it has high compliance demands but also a large market with clients actively looking for sustainable solutions. Norway might have slightly fewer formal obstacles but also less market pull so far – meaning you may have to convince clients and officials more about why to do reuse (whereas in Sweden/Finland it’s increasingly expected or at least accepted). If the question is “where to start or invest effort?”: Starting in the home turf (Finland) makes sense as a baseline, but among new markets, Sweden has a bigger immediate focus on circular interiors (especially with many hotel renovations upcoming and clients like Scandic pushing it). The regulations are tough but this detailed guide shows it’s navigable. Norway may lag a couple of years in demand; perhaps enter Norway slightly later when the market is more ripe (unless you get a visionary client there early). From a pure ease-of-compliance perspective, one could argue Norway’s lack of climate declaration now or Finland’s more flexible renovation approach historically made those easier. But ease isn’t everything – where there is more requirement (like Sweden’s climate law), there is also more *value* to the service you provide. Thus, Sweden offers high potential but requires careful compliance management, Finland offers a supportive policy framework and growing need, and Norway might become a huge market once the ball starts rolling (oil companies and big property owners there are waking up to circular economy, and once they do, they move fast).

## **Continuous Monitoring & Resources**

To keep up with changing regulations and best practices, Fyra should set up a system for continuous monitoring. Key sources and tools include: Primary Regulatory Sources:

* Regeringen.se & Riksdagen.se: These sites publish new laws, bills, and government inquiries. Subscribing to press releases from the Ministry of Infrastructure (which covers building) and Ministry of Environment will inform you of upcoming proposals or changes. For example, when the government sent the new bygglov simplification law, regeringen.se had a press release and the bill text.  
* Boverket (National Board of Housing, Building and Planning): Boverket’s website has a dedicated section for Cirkulär ekonomi and they update guidelines regularly (as evidenced by many references used). Their newsletters (which one can sign up to via email) often highlight “new regulations from date X” and news like climate declaration updates or new BBR editions. Also, Boverket sometimes hosts webinars on new rules – worth attending.  
* Naturvårdsverket (Environmental Protection Agency): They oversee waste and environmental rules. Check their publications or updates on waste sorting, end-of-waste, producer responsibility developments. Naturvårdsverket’s website and newsletter can keep you abreast of, say, new guidance on circular material flows or changes in waste ordinance.  
* Arbetsmiljöverket: Follow their updates for any new worker safety regulations (they occasionally release new AFS rules, e.g. recently on quartz dust, etc., which could impact material handling).  
* EU Official Journal (EUR-Lex): Monitor EU regulations in pipeline – e.g., a revision of the Construction Products Regulation, or the proposed EU Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). Since EU rules eventually reflect in Swedish law, knowing them early helps. You can set alerts on EUR-Lex for keywords like “construction reuse” or follow the European Commission’s environment news.

Industry and Network Sources:

* Sweden Green Building Council (SGBC): As a member (if you aren’t, consider joining), SGBC provides updates on green building certifications, training, and often policy news. They have working groups on circularity where members share experiences. Their newsletter and magazine (Gröna Byggnader) often feature case studies.  
* Byggföretagen (Swedish Construction Federation): They sometimes publish guides or lobby info about upcoming regulations (like how the industry responds to a new law). Being plugged into them or attending their events can give insight.  
* Trade Media: *Byggindustrin*, *Byggvärlden*, *Fastighetsnytt* (for real estate) – these often summarize new laws in a digestible way and provide commentary. For example, an article in Byggindustrin might explain “What the new building code means for renovations” with expert opinions – very useful.  
* Visita (Hospitality industry association in Sweden): Visita might not delve into building regs deeply, but they do cover any regulation affecting hotels. They have published sustainability handbooks for hotels. If there’s something like a fire safety regulation change for hotels, you’d see it there. They also might highlight funding opportunities or pilot programs for hotel sustainability which could tie into circular renovations.  
* Research and Academia: The Nordic countries publish a lot of research on circular economy in construction (e.g., via Chalmers University, Lund University, etc.). Keeping an eye on new research can give hints at future directions. For example, if a thesis indicates a certain legal barrier, that often becomes known in industry circles and can lead to policy change.  
* Nordic Collaboration: Engage with the Nordic Circular Hotspot and similar networks. There are cross-country forums and perhaps a Slack or LinkedIn group for professionals working on circular construction in Scandinavia. People often share news like “hey, Finland just passed this law” or “anyone have experience reusing windows in Norway?” – a great real-time learning avenue.

Monitoring Frequency and Method:

* Dedicate time quarterly to review the official sources for any changes that came into effect or are upcoming. Perhaps create an internal newsletter or Slack channel at Fyra where any team member can drop news about regulations.  
* Assign a team member as the “Compliance Lead” to attend relevant webinars (Boverket does info sessions whenever a major code update is released – these are gold for understanding how the authority expects compliance).  
* Use automation: for example, Google Alerts for terms like “återbruk bygglag ändring” or “byggmaterial lagstiftning EU” can send you an email when those appear in news.  
* Subscribe to Boverket’s “For professionals” RSS feed if available, and to SGBC’s update list.  
* Keep an eye on public consultations (remiss): Sweden often sends new proposals out for comment. If something like “proposal to require resource inventory for demolitions” comes, you might even contribute comments via industry associations. If not, at least you get a preview that this rule is likely coming and can prepare.

Staying Agile: It’s not just about receiving info – set up internal lunch-and-learn sessions whenever a new regulation is confirmed. For example, when the climate declaration limit for 2027 is announced, have a meeting on how Fyra will ensure compliance (maybe even go beyond compliance to be ready for stricter future limits). Red Flags to Watch:

* Any mention of “förbud” (ban) on materials – e.g. “EU bans XYZ flame retardant” is a red flag to immediately check if that affects any reused furniture stock.  
* “Skärpta krav” (tightened requirements) in BBR or PBL – e.g., if they tighten energy requirements further or introduce a minimum percentage of materials that must be recycled content (something that could happen via EU).  
* Insurance industry changes: Sometimes not law but insurers collectively decide something (for instance, if fires involving battery storage increase, insurers might require additional measures for hotels with certain systems – indirectly affecting your MEP design if you reuse certain equipment).  
* Environmental zones or local ordinances: Big cities sometimes implement local rules (e.g., a city might say any project on city-owned land must meet certain reuse targets). Those don’t show up in national sources, so monitor city websites or reach out to contacts in city planning departments.

By implementing an active monitoring regimen, Fyra can remain ahead of compliance issues rather than reacting. This not only avoids legal pitfalls but positions the firm as knowledgeable leaders – an edge when regulations become more demanding because you’ll already have the solutions in practice.
