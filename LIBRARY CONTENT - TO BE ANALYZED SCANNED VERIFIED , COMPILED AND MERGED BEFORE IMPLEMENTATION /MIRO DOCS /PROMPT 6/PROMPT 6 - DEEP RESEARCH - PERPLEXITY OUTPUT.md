# **Foregangs-Hotelloperatører i Sirkulær Økonomi: Sverige & Norden**

## **Executive Summary**

This research identifies 21 forerunner hotels and hotel operators in Sweden and the Nordic region demonstrating leadership in circular economy practices related to interior, furniture, and materials. The Swedish circular hospitality movement is emerging to mature, with clear pioneers concentrated in Stockholm but examples across the country. Denmark shows stronger maturity, Finland has robust furniture recycling infrastructure, and Norway is in early stages.

**Key Findings:**

* **Sweden: 12 hotels identified** (5 Stockholm, 1 Göteborg, 1 Malmö, 3 Lapland/other, 2 national chains)

* **Denmark: 3 hotels** (Copenhagen-focused adaptive reuse leaders)

* **Finland: 3 hotels** (strong furniture recycling systems)

* **Norway: 2 hotels** (emerging circular practices)

* **Iceland: 1 hotel** (regional circular economy focus)

**Market Maturity:** Sweden's circular hospitality sector is growing rapidly (2019-2025 surge), with proven business cases (Blique Hotel saved 3,600 tons CO2 and €8.6M in materials), strong certification infrastructure (Nordic Swan Ecolabel covers 96% of Scandic's 280 hotels), and world-leading eco-certification rates (Göteborg: 88-96% of hotel rooms eco-certified).[fallzhotels+8](https://www.fallzhotels.com/swedens-hotel-industry-sustainable-growth-in-2024-and-a-bright-future-for-2025)​

**Top Opportunity for Fyra:** The Swedish market presents significant potential with boutique/design hotels showing highest receptiveness to circular interior innovation, strong policy support through new circular furniture procurement frameworks, and 15-year hotel renovation cycles creating continuous demand.[scandichotelsgroup+1](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/sustainability/vision-and-strategy/sleep/)​

 Adaptive reuse of 1930s warehouse and office building complex in Stockholm's Hagastaden district, transforming underutilized historic structures into 249-room boutique design hotel.[sweco+3](https://www.sweco.se/aktuellt/nyheter/stora-kostnadsbesparingar-mojliga-genom-cirkulart-byggande/)​

**The Challenge:**  
 Original buildings (designed by architect Sigurd Lewerentz) had low ceiling heights making them unsuitable for modern office use. Standard approach would have been demolition and new construction.[byggfakta+1](https://byggfakta.today/stora-vinster-med-aaterbruk-vid-renovering-183501/nyhet.html)​

**The Circular Solution:**  
 Sweco architects identified massive reuse potential. By renovating rather than demolishing:

* **3,600 tons CO2 saved** (equivalent of removing hundreds of cars from road for a year)[ccbuild+2](https://ccbuild.se/kunskapsbank/referensprojekt/projekt/?Id=27)​

* **€8.6 million** saved in materials not purchased[sweco+2](https://www.sweco.se/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/Urban-Insight-by-Sweco_Building-the-future.pdf)​

* **€120 million total savings** vs. demolition \+ new construction[sweco+1](https://www.sweco.se/vart-erbjudande/miljo-och-hallbarhet/cirkular-ekonomi/aterbruk/vaga-satsa-pa-aterbruk/)​

**Key Circular Strategies:**

1. **Building Structure:** Entire existing structure retained and renovated rather than demolished[sweco+1](https://www.sweco.se/aktuellt/nyheter/stora-kostnadsbesparingar-mojliga-genom-cirkulart-byggande/)​

2. **Material Reuse:** Extensive reuse of building materials throughout renovation (specific quantities: 3,600 tons worth of materials)[byggfakta+1](https://byggfakta.today/stora-vinster-med-aaterbruk-vid-renovering-183501/nyhet.html)​

3. **Design Approach:** Raw, austere aesthetic celebrating existing concrete rather than covering it up \- "left concrete essentially as we found it"[archdaily](https://www.archdaily.com/918619/blique-hotel-by-nobis-wingardh-arkitektkontor)​

4. **On-site Food Production:**

   * Indoor farm with in-house farmer growing produce for Nobis group hotels across Stockholm[designhotels](https://www.designhotels.com/culture/conscious-eye/our-conscious-eye-on-blique-by-nobis/)​

   * Rooftop gardens[bliquebynobis+1](https://www.bliquebynobis.se/en/sustainability-at-blique-by-nobis)​

   * Courtyard gardens[byggfakta](https://byggfakta.today/stora-vinster-med-aaterbruk-vid-renovering-183501/nyhet.html)​

   * All food waste composted and returned to gardens[designhotels](https://www.designhotels.com/culture/conscious-eye/our-conscious-eye-on-blique-by-nobis/)​

5. **Operational Circularity:**

   * Climate-labeled menus via Klimato partnership \- guests see CO2 impact per dish[bliquebynobis+1](https://www.bliquebynobis.se/hallbarhet-pa-blique)​

   * KITRO food waste measurement technology[designhotels](https://www.designhotels.com/culture/conscious-eye/our-conscious-eye-on-blique-by-nobis/)​

* Boutique hotels seeking unique character through heritage

* Projects where reversibility is required or desired

**Challenges & Solutions:**

*Challenge:* Small room sizes (177 sq ft) inherited from 1699 design  
 *Solution:* Pale colors, mirrors next to windows, wood/stone materials create sense of spaciousness[interiordesign](https://interiordesign.net/projects/rewriting-history-claesson-koivisto-rune-turns-an-historic-stokholm-landmark-into-a-boutique-hotel/)​

*Challenge:* Cannot modify original structure  
 *Solution:* All new elements designed as "insertions" (bathrooms, furniture, lighting)[claessonkoivistorune+1](https://www.claessonkoivistorune.se/projects/hotel-skeppsholmen/)​

*Challenge:* Need modern functionality in historic building  
 *Solution:* Contemporary fixtures (lighting, furniture) designed by Claesson Koivisto Rune specifically for project[claessonkoivistorune+1](https://www.claessonkoivistorune.se/projects/hotel-skeppsholmen/)​

## **VI. Landscape Analysis & Strategic Recommendations**

## **State of Circular Hospitality in Sweden**

**Movement Maturity: EMERGING TO MATURE**

**Evidence of Maturity:**

* Clear pioneers exist with documented impact (Blique: 3,600 tons CO2 saved)[sweco+1](https://www.sweco.se/aktuellt/nyheter/stora-kostnadsbesparingar-mojliga-genom-cirkulart-byggande/)​

* Zero-energy hotel achieved (House of Choice)[app2.editnews+1](https://app2.editnews.com/page/read.ashx?issueid=493882)​

* Chain-wide implementation (Scandic: 96% Nordic Swan certified, 280 hotels)[scandichotelsgroup+1](https://www.scandichotelsgroup.com/files/Reports/Annual_reports/2024/Scandic-annual-and-sustainability-report-2024-print.pdf)​

* World-leading eco-certification rates (Göteborg: 88-96% of rooms)[forbes+2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2024/10/05/how-this-swedish-city-became-one-of-the-worlds-most-sustainable-places/)​

* Policy support: Swedish authority circular furniture procurement framework (2023)[inputinterior](https://www.inputinterior.com/news/swedish-authority-spending-on-reused-furnishings-in-the-millions/)​

* Strong supplier infrastructure (Input interior/Greenified, Yllw, Freshrent)[inputinterior+2](https://www.inputinterior.com/news/swedish-authority-spending-on-reused-furnishings-in-the-millions/)​

**Evidence of Emergence:**

* Concentration in Stockholm (5-6 major examples) \- limited geographic spread yet

* Most exemplary projects recent (2019-2025 period)

* Many hotels still at "eco-certification" level without deep circularity

* Limited inter-hotel furniture reuse systems (Fjærland Norway shows potential)[fjaerlandhotel](https://fjaerlandhotel.com/sustainability)​

* Supply-demand connection still developing

**Trends:**
